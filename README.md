    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) is a mathematical framework for releasing
information with formal privacy guarantees. Despite the existence of various DP
procedures for performing a wide range of statistical analysis and machine
learning tasks, methods of good utility are still lacking in valid statistical
inference with DP guarantees. We address this gap by introducing the notion of
valid Privacy-Preserving Interval Estimation (PPIE) and proposing
PRivacy-loss-Efficient and Consistent Inference based on poSterior quantilEs
(PRECISE). PRECISE is a general-purpose Bayesian approach for constructing
privacy-preserving posterior intervals. We establish the Mean-Squared-Error
(MSE) consistency for our proposed private posterior quantiles converging to
the population posterior quantile as sample size or privacy loss increases. We
conduct extensive experiments to compare the utilities of PRECISE with common
existing privacy-preserving inferential approaches in various inferential
tasks, data types and sizes,and privacy loss levels. The results demonstrated a
significant advantage of PRECISE with its nominal coverage and substantially
narrower intervals than the existing methods, which are prone to either
under-coverage or impractically wide intervals.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> \begin{abstract} This paper comprehensively analyzes privacy policies in
AR/VR applications, leveraging BERT, a state-of-the-art text classification
model, to evaluate the clarity and thoroughness of these policies. By comparing
the privacy policies of AR/VR applications with those of free and premium
websites, this study provides a broad perspective on the current state of
privacy practices within the AR/VR industry. Our findings indicate that AR/VR
applications generally offer a higher percentage of positive segments than free
content but lower than premium websites. The analysis of highlighted segments
and words revealed that AR/VR applications strategically emphasize critical
privacy practices and key terms. This enhances privacy policies' clarity and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> By 2050, electric vehicles (EVs) are projected to account for 70% of global
vehicle sales. While EVs provide environmental benefits, they also pose
challenges for energy generation, grid infrastructure, and data privacy.
Current research on EV routing and charge management often overlooks privacy
when predicting energy demands, leaving sensitive mobility data vulnerable. To
address this, we developed a Federated Learning Transformer Network (FLTN) to
predict EVs' next charge location with enhanced privacy measures. Each EV
operates as a client, training an onboard FLTN model that shares only model
weights, not raw data with a community-based Distributed Energy Resource
Management System (DERMS), which aggregates them into a community global model.
To further enhance privacy, non-transitory EVs use peer-to-peer weight sharing
and augmentation within their community, obfuscating individual contributions
and improving model accuracy. Community DERMS global model weights are then
redistributed to EVs for continuous training. Our FLTN approach achieved up to
92% accuracy while preserving data privacy, compared to our baseline
centralised model, which achieved 98% accuracy with no data privacy.
Simulations conducted across diverse charge levels confirm the FLTN's ability
to forecast energy demands over extended periods. We present a privacy-focused
solution for forecasting EV charge location prediction, effectively mitigating
data leakage risks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Reproduction numbers are widely used for the estimation and prediction of
epidemic spreading processes over networks. However, conventional reproduction
numbers of an overall network do not indicate where an epidemic is spreading.
Therefore, we propose a novel notion of local distributed reproduction numbers
to capture the spreading behaviors of each node in a network. We first show how
to compute them and then use them to derive new conditions under which an
outbreak can occur. These conditions are then used to derive new conditions for
the existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibrium states of the
underlying epidemic model. Building upon these local distributed reproduction
numbers, we define cluster distributed reproduction numbers to model the spread
between clusters composed of nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local
distributed reproduction numbers can be aggregated into cluster distributed
reproduction numbers at different scales. However, both local and cluster
distributed reproduction numbers can reveal the frequency of interactions
between nodes in a network, which raises privacy concerns. Thus, we next
develop a privacy framework that implements a differential privacy mechanism to
provably protect the frequency of interactions between nodes when computing
distributed reproduction numbers. Numerical experiments show that, even under
differential privacy, the distributed reproduction numbers provide accurate
estimates of the epidemic spread while also providing more insights than
conventional reproduction numbers.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The rapid proliferation of speech-enabled technologies, including virtual
assistants, video conferencing platforms, and wearable devices, has raised
significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inference of sensitive
emotional information from audio data. Existing privacy-preserving methods
often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical
scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages
familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation,
to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing
popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified
these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated
their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks
from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language
Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on
three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation
effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design
principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the age of data-driven decision making, preserving privacy while providing
personalized experiences has become paramount. Personalized Federated Learning
(PFL) offers a promising framework by decentralizing the learning process, thus
ensuring data privacy and reducing reliance on centralized data repositories.
However, the integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
within PFL remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach that
enhances PFL with cutting-edge AI methodologies including adaptive

that not only boosts the performance of individual client models but also
ensures robust privacy-preserving mechanisms and efficient resource utilization
across heterogeneous networks. Empirical results demonstrate significant
improvements in model accuracy and personalization, along with stringent
privacy adherence, as compared to conventional federated learning models. This
work paves the way for a new era of truly personalized and privacy-conscious AI

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This work aims to provide both privacy and utility within a split learning
framework while considering both forward attribute inference and backward
reconstruction attacks. To address this, a novel approach has been proposed,
which makes use of class activation maps and autoencoders as a plug-in strategy

feature map onto a lower-dimensional feature space. Our work shows that our
proposed autoencoder-based approach is preferred as it can provide protection
at an earlier split position over the tested architectures in our setting, and,
hence, better utility for resource-constrained devices in edge-cloud

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Phishing attacks, typically carried out by email, remain a significant
cybersecurity threat with attackers creating legitimate-looking websites to
deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information or executing harmful
actions. In this paper, we propose {\bf EPhishCADE}, the first {\em
privacy-aware}, {\em multi-dimensional} framework for {\bf E}mail {\bf

phishing campaigns by clustering seemingly unrelated attacks. Our framework
employs a hierarchical architecture combining a structural layer and a
contextual layer, offering a comprehensive analysis of phishing attacks by
thoroughly examining both structural and contextual elements. Specifically, we
implement a graph-based contextual layer to reveal hidden similarities across
multiple dimensions, including textual, numeric, temporal, and spatial
features, among attacks that may initially appear unrelated. Our framework
streamlines the handling of security threat reports, reducing analysts' fatigue
and workload while enhancing protection against these threats. Another key
feature of our framework lies in its sole reliance on phishing URLs in emails
without the need for private information, including senders, recipients,
content, etc. This feature enables a collaborative identification of phishing
campaigns and attacks among multiple organizations without compromising
privacy. Finally, we benchmark our framework against an established

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the last years, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, precision medicine
platforms emerged as useful tools for supporting new tests like the ones that
detect the presence of antibodies and antigens with better sensitivity and
specificity than traditional methods. In addition, the pandemic has also
influenced the way people interact (decentralization), behave (digital world)
and purchase health services (online). Moreover, there is a growing concern in
the way health data are managed, especially in terms of privacy. To tackle such
issues, this article presents a sustainable direct-to-consumer health-service
open-source platform called HELENE that is supported by blockchain and by a
novel decentralized oracle that protects patient data privacy. Specifically,
HELENE enables health test providers to compete through auctions, allowing
patients to bid for their services and to keep the control over their health
test results. Moreover, data exchanges among the involved stakeholders can be
performed in a trustworthy, transparent and standardized way to ease software
integration and to avoid incompatibilities. After providing a thorough
description of the platform, the proposed health platform is assessed in terms
of smart contract performance. In addition, the response time of the developed
oracle is evaluated and NIST SP 800-22 tests are executed to demonstrate the
adequacy of the devised random number generator. Thus, this article shows the
capabilities and novel propositions of HELENE for delivering health services
providing an open-source platform for future researchers, who can enhance it

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Model-free power flow calculation, driven by the rise of smart meter (SM)
data and the lack of network topology, often relies on artificial intelligence
neural networks (ANNs). However, training ANNs require vast amounts of SM data,
posing privacy risks for households in distribution networks. To ensure
customers' privacy during the SM data gathering and online sharing, we
introduce a privacy preserving PF calculation framework, composed of two local
strategies: a local randomisation strategy (LRS) and a local zero-knowledge
proof (ZKP)-based data collection strategy. First, the LRS is used to achieve
irreversible transformation and robust privacy protection for active and
reactive power data, thereby ensuring that personal data remains confidential.
Subsequently, the ZKP-based data collecting strategy is adopted to securely
gather the training dataset for the ANN, enabling SMs to interact with the
distribution system operator without revealing the actual voltage magnitude.
Moreover, to mitigate the accuracy loss induced by the seasonal variations in
load profiles, an incremental learning strategy is incorporated into the online
application. The results across three datasets with varying measurement errors
demonstrate that the proposed framework efficiently collects one month of SM
data within one hour. Furthermore, it robustly maintains mean errors of 0.005
p.u. and 0.014 p.u. under multiple measurement errors and seasonal variations
in load profiles, respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Chemical reaction data is a pivotal asset, driving advances in competitive
fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, and industrial chemistry.
Its proprietary nature renders it sensitive, as it often includes confidential
insights and competitive advantages organizations strive to protect. However,
in contrast to this need for confidentiality, the current standard training
paradigm for machine learning-based retrosynthesis gathers reaction data from
multiple sources into one single edge to train prediction models. This paradigm
poses considerable privacy risks as it necessitates broad data availability
across organizational boundaries and frequent data transmission between
entities, potentially exposing proprietary information to unauthorized access
or interception during storage and transfer. In the present study, we introduce
the chemical knowledge-informed framework (CKIF), a privacy-preserving approach
for learning retrosynthesis models. CKIF enables distributed training across
multiple chemical organizations without compromising the confidentiality of
proprietary reaction data. Instead of gathering raw reaction data, CKIF learns
retrosynthesis models through iterative, chemical knowledge-informed
aggregation of model parameters. In particular, the chemical properties of
predicted reactants are leveraged to quantitatively assess the observable
behaviors of individual models, which in turn determines the adaptive weights
used for model aggregation. On a variety of reaction datasets, CKIF outperforms
several strong baselines by a clear margin (e.g., ~20% performance improvement
over FedAvg on USPTO-50K), showing its feasibility and superiority to stimulate
further research on privacy-preserving retrosynthesis.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Through a three-part co-design study involving 19 teens aged 13-18, we
identify key barriers to effective boundary regulation on social media,
including ambiguous audience expectations, social risks associated with
oversharing, and the lack of design affordances that facilitate trust-building.
Our findings reveal that while adolescents seek casual, frequent sharing to
strengthen relationships, existing platform norms and designs often discourage
such interactions, leading to withdrawal. To address these challenges, we
introduce trust-enabled privacy as a design framework that recognizes trust,
whether building or eroding, as central to boundary regulation. When trust is
supported, boundary regulation becomes more adaptive and empowering; when it
erodes, users default to self-censorship or withdrawal. We propose concrete
design affordances, including guided disclosure, contextual audience
segmentation, intentional engagement signaling, and trust-centered norms, to
help platforms foster a more dynamic and nuanced privacy experience for teen
social media users. By reframing privacy as a trust-driven process rather than
a rigid control-based trade-off, this work provides empirical insights and
actionable guidelines for designing social media environments that empower
teens to manage their online presence while fostering meaningful social

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP) provides a framework
for collaborative machine learning, enabling clients to train a shared model
while adhering to strict privacy constraints. The framework allows each client
to have an individual privacy guarantee, e.g., by adding different amounts of
noise to each client's model updates. One underlying assumption is that all
clients spend their privacy budgets uniformly over time (learning rounds).
However, it has been shown in the literature that learning in early rounds
typically focuses on more coarse-grained features that can be learned at lower
signal-to-noise ratios while later rounds learn fine-grained features that
benefit from higher signal-to-noise ratios. Building on this intuition, we
propose a time-adaptive DP-FL framework that expends the privacy budget
non-uniformly across both time and clients. Our framework enables each client
to save privacy budget in early rounds so as to be able to spend more in later
rounds when additional accuracy is beneficial in learning more fine-grained
features. We theoretically prove utility improvements in the case that clients
with stricter privacy budgets spend budgets unevenly across rounds, compared to
clients with more relaxed budgets, who have sufficient budgets to distribute
their spend more evenly. Our practical experiments on standard benchmark
datasets support our theoretical results and show that, in practice, our
algorithms improve the privacy-utility trade-offs compared to baseline schemes.</p>

Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only
secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all
transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN
integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation
Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and
temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM
optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while
CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced
participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle
mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with
increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart
city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation,
and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility
ecosystems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As machine learning models increasingly process sensitive data, understanding
their vulnerability to privacy attacks is vital. Membership inference attacks
(MIAs) exploit model responses to infer whether specific data points were used
during training, posing a significant privacy risk. Prior research suggests
that spiking neural networks (SNNs), which rely on event-driven computation and
discrete spike-based encoding, exhibit greater resilience to MIAs than
artificial neural networks (ANNs). This resilience stems from their
non-differentiable activations and inherent stochasticity, which obscure the
correlation between model responses and individual training samples. To enhance
privacy in SNNs, we explore two techniques: quantization and surrogate
gradients. Quantization, which reduces precision to limit information leakage,
has improved privacy in ANNs. Given SNNs' sparse and irregular activations,
quantization may further disrupt the activation patterns exploited by MIAs. We
assess the vulnerability of SNNs and ANNs under weight and activation
quantization across multiple datasets, using the attack model's receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric, where
lower values indicate stronger privacy, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy
trade-off. Our findings show that quantization enhances privacy in both
architectures with minimal performance loss, though full-precision SNNs remain
more resilient than quantized ANNs. Additionally, we examine the impact of
surrogate gradients on privacy in SNNs. Among five evaluated gradients, spike
rate escape provides the best privacy-accuracy trade-off, while arctangent
increases vulnerability to MIAs. These results reinforce SNNs' inherent privacy
advantages and demonstrate that quantization and surrogate gradient selection
significantly influence privacy-accuracy trade-offs in SNNs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised
significant privacy concerns regarding the exposure of personally identifiable

query-unrelated PII masking strategy and introduce PII-Bench, the first

PII-Bench comprises 2,842 test samples across 55 fine-grained PII categories,
featuring diverse scenarios from single-subject descriptions to complex
multi-party interactions. Each sample is carefully crafted with a user query,
context description, and standard answer indicating query-relevant PII. Our
empirical evaluation reveals that while current models perform adequately in
basic PII detection, they show significant limitations in determining PII query
relevance. Even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, particularly in
handling complex multi-subject scenarios, indicating substantial room for
improvement in achieving intelligent PII masking.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Tensor-valued data, increasingly common in applications like spatiotemporal
modeling and social networks, pose unique challenges for privacy protection due
to their multidimensional structure and the risk of losing critical structural
information. Traditional local differential privacy (LDP) methods, designed for
scalars and matrices, are insufficient for tensors, as they fail to preserve
essential relationships among tensor elements. We introduce TLDP, a novel
\emph{LDP} algorithm for \emph{T}ensors, which employs a randomized response
mechanism to perturb tensor components while maintaining structural integrity.
To strike a better balance between utility and privacy, we incorporate a weight
matrix that selectively protects sensitive regions. Both theoretical analysis
and empirical findings from real-world datasets show that TLDP achieves
superior utility while preserving privacy, making it a robust solution for
high-dimensional data.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to
protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its
privacy guarantees often come at the cost of model performance, largely due to
the inherent challenge of accurately quantifying privacy loss. While recent
efforts have strengthened privacy guarantees by focusing solely on the final
output and bounded domain cases, they still impose restrictive assumptions,
such as convexity and other parameter limitations, and often lack a thorough
analysis of utility. In this paper, we provide rigorous privacy and utility
characterization for DPSGD for smooth loss functions in both bounded and
unbounded domains. We track the privacy loss over multiple iterations by
exploiting the noisy smooth-reduction property and establish the utility
analysis by leveraging the projection's non-expansiveness and clipped SGD
properties. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i)
the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, and (ii)
a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously
under certain conditions. Numerical results validate our results.</p>

specifically the equitable distribution of privacy risk. This is critical in
federated learning (FL), where decentralized data necessitates balanced privacy

(2) client-side regularization to reduce client vulnerability. This
comprehensive strategy targets both the symptoms and root causes of privacy
unfairness. Evaluated on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and CIFAR-10

minimal impact on model utility, and effectively mitigates SIA risks on

recommendations that simplify everyday tasks, but their reliance on sensitive
user data raises concerns about privacy and trust. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Guardian of Data (GOD), a secure, privacy-preserving framework
for training and evaluating AI assistants directly on-device. Unlike
traditional benchmarks, the GOD model measures how well assistants can
anticipate user needs-such as suggesting gifts-while protecting user data and
autonomy. Functioning like an AI school, it addresses the cold start problem by
simulating user queries and employing a curriculum-based approach to refine the
performance of each assistant. Running within a Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE), it safeguards user data while applying reinforcement and imitation
learning to refine AI recommendations. A token-based incentive system
encourages users to share data securely, creating a data flywheel that drives
continuous improvement. Specifically, users mine with their data, and the
mining rate is determined by GOD's evaluation of how well their AI assistant
understands them across categories such as shopping, social interactions,
productivity, trading, and Web3. By integrating privacy, personalization, and
trust, the GOD model provides a scalable, responsible path for advancing
personal AI assistants. For community collaboration, part of the framework is

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rise of large language models (LLMs), increasing research has
recognized their risk of leaking personally identifiable information (PII)
under malicious attacks. Although efforts have been made to protect PII in
LLMs, existing methods struggle to balance privacy protection with maintaining
model utility. In this paper, inspired by studies of amnesia in cognitive
science, we propose a novel approach, Proactive Privacy Amnesia (PPA), to
safeguard PII in LLMs while preserving their utility. This mechanism works by
actively identifying and forgetting key memories most closely associated with
PII in sequences, followed by a memory implanting using suitable substitute
memories to maintain the LLM's functionality. We conduct evaluations across
multiple models to protect common PII, such as phone numbers and physical
addresses, against prevalent PII-targeted attacks, demonstrating the
superiority of our method compared with other existing defensive techniques.
The results show that our PPA method completely eliminates the risk of phone
number exposure by 100% and significantly reduces the risk of physical address
exposure by 9.8% - 87.6%, all while maintaining comparable model utility
performance.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this paper, we investigate the necessity of memorization in stochastic
convex optimization (SCO) under $\ell_p$ geometries. Informally, we say a
learning algorithm memorizes $m$ samples (or is $m$-traceable) if, by analyzing
its output, it is possible to identify at least $m$ of its training samples.
Our main results uncover a fundamental tradeoff between traceability and excess
risk in SCO. For every $p\in [1,\infty)$, we establish the existence of a risk
threshold below which any sample-efficient learner must memorize a \em{constant
fraction} of its sample. For $p\in [1,2]$, this threshold coincides with best
risk of differentially private (DP) algorithms, i.e., above this threshold,
there are algorithms that do not memorize even a single sample. This
establishes a sharp dichotomy between privacy and traceability for $p \in
[1,2]$. For $p \in (2,\infty)$, this threshold instead gives novel lower bounds
for DP learning, partially closing an open problem in this setup. En route of
proving these results, we introduce a complexity notion we term \em{trace
value} of a problem, which unifies privacy lower bounds and traceability
results, and prove a sparse variant of the fingerprinting lemma.</p>

properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight
the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially
private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted
Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish
guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology
based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds
for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform
in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent advancements in generative large language models (LLMs) have enabled
wider applicability, accessibility, and flexibility. However, their reliability
and trustworthiness are still in doubt, especially for concerns regarding
individuals' data privacy. Great efforts have been made on privacy by building
various evaluation benchmarks to study LLMs' privacy awareness and robustness
from their generated outputs to their hidden representations. Unfortunately,
most of these works adopt a narrow formulation of privacy and only investigate
personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we follow the merit
of the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory, which posits that privacy evaluation
should not only cover the transmitted attributes but also encompass the whole
relevant social context through private information flows. We present
PrivaCI-Bench, a comprehensive contextual privacy evaluation benchmark targeted
at legal compliance to cover well-annotated privacy and safety regulations,
real court cases, privacy policies, and synthetic data built from the official
toolkit to study LLMs' privacy and safety compliance. We evaluate the latest
LLMs, including the recent reasoner models QwQ-32B and Deepseek R1. Our
experimental results suggest that though LLMs can effectively capture key CI

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As the importance of Privacy-Preserving Inference of Transformers (PiT)
increases, a hybrid protocol that integrates Garbled Circuits (GC) and
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is emerging for its implementation. While this
protocol is preferred for its ability to maintain accuracy, it has a severe
drawback of excessive latency. To address this, existing protocols primarily
focused on reducing HE latency, thus making GC the new latency bottleneck.
Furthermore, previous studies only focused on individual computing layers, such
as protocol or hardware accelerator, lacking a comprehensive solution at the
system level. This paper presents APINT, a full-stack framework designed to
reduce PiT's overall latency by addressing the latency problem of GC through
both software and hardware solutions. APINT features a novel protocol that
reallocates possible GC workloads to alternative methods (i.e., HE or standard
matrix operation), substantially decreasing the GC workload. It also suggests
GC-friendly circuit generation that reduces the number of AND gates at the
most, which is the expensive operator in GC. Furthermore, APINT proposes an
innovative netlist scheduling that combines coarse-grained operation mapping
and fine-grained scheduling for maximal data reuse and minimal dependency.
Finally, APINT's hardware accelerator, combined with its compiler speculation,
effectively resolves the memory stall issue. Putting it all together, APINT
achieves a remarkable end-to-end reduction in latency, outperforming the
existing protocol on CPU platform by 12.2x online and 2.2x offline. Meanwhile,
the APINT accelerator not only reduces its latency by 3.3x but also saves
energy consumption by 4.6x while operating PiT compared to the state-of-the-art
GC accelerator.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Neural networks are susceptible to privacy attacks that can extract private
information of the training set. To cope, several training algorithms guarantee
differential privacy (DP) by adding noise to their computation. However, DP
requires to add noise considering every possible training set. This leads to a
significant decrease in the network's accuracy. Individual DP (iDP) restricts
DP to a given training set. We observe that some inputs deterministically
satisfy iDP without any noise. By identifying them, we can provide iDP
label-only access to the network with a minor decrease to its accuracy.
However, identifying the inputs that satisfy iDP without any noise is highly
challenging. Our key idea is to compute the iDP deterministic bound (iDP-DB),
which overapproximates the set of inputs that do not satisfy iDP, and add noise
only to their predicted labels. To compute the tightest iDP-DB, which enables
to guard the label-only access with minimal accuracy decrease, we propose
LUCID, which leverages several formal verification techniques. First, it
encodes the problem as a mixed-integer linear program, defined over a network
and over every network trained identically but without a unique data point.
Second, it abstracts a set of networks using a hyper-network. Third, it
eliminates the overapproximation error via a novel branch-and-bound technique.
Fourth, it bounds the differences of matching neurons in the network and the
hyper-network and employs linear relaxation if they are small. We show that
LUCID can provide classifiers with a perfect individuals' privacy guarantee
(0-iDP) -- which is infeasible for DP training algorithms -- with an accuracy
decrease of 1.4%. For more relaxed $\varepsilon$-iDP guarantees, LUCID has an
accuracy decrease of 1.2%. In contrast, existing DP training algorithms reduce
the accuracy by 12.7%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted many individuals to
fine-tune them for domain-specific tasks by uploading their data. However, in
sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, privacy concerns often arise. One
promising solution is to sample synthetic data with Differential Privacy (DP)
guarantees to replace private data. However, these synthetic data contain
significant flawed data, which are considered as noise. Existing solutions
typically rely on naive filtering by comparing ROUGE-L scores or embedding
similarities, which are ineffective in addressing the noise. To address this

fine-tunes a reward proxy model and uses reward signals to guide the synthetic

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal
lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks involved. The moment
users share information with these agents (e.g., LLMs), their private
information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the
notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLMs. It aims to
minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only
information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended
goals when interacting with LLMs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative
design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently
reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights
from this study, we propose a locally-deployable framework that operates
between users and LLMs, and identifies and reformulates out-of-context
information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows
that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving
strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended
interaction goals through different approaches to classify information relevant
to the intended goals.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Edge inference (EI) is a key solution to address the growing challenges of
delayed response times, limited scalability, and privacy concerns in
cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference. However, deploying DNN models
on resource-constrained edge devices faces more severe challenges, such as
model storage limitations, dynamic service requests, and privacy risks. This
paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-aware joint DNN model deployment
and partition optimization to minimize long-term average inference delay under
resource and privacy constraints. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a
complex optimization problem considering model deployment, user-server
association, and model partition strategies. To handle the NP-hardness and
future uncertainties, a Lyapunov-based approach is introduced to transform the
long-term optimization into a single-time-slot problem, ensuring system
performance. Additionally, a coalition formation game model is proposed for
edge server association, and a greedy-based algorithm is developed for model
deployment within each coalition to efficiently solve the problem. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed algorithms effectively reduce inference
delay while satisfying privacy constraints, outperforming baseline approaches
in various scenarios.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Due to the sensitive nature of personally identifiable information (PII), its
owners may have the authority to control its inclusion or request its removal
from large-language model (LLM) training. Beyond this, PII may be added or
removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques,
because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included
in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII
memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training
pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three
such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can
elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted
memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3);
(2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our
settings, as much as $\approx\!7.5\times$); and (3) removing PII can lead to
other PII being memorized. Model creators should consider these first- and
second-order privacy risks when training models to avoid the risk of new PII
regurgitation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The use of machine learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in various
domains, highlighting the importance of understanding and ensuring its safety.
One pressing concern is the vulnerability of ML applications to model stealing
attacks. These attacks involve adversaries attempting to recover a learned
model through limited query-response interactions, such as those found in
cloud-based services or on-chip artificial intelligence interfaces. While
existing literature proposes various attack and defense strategies, these often
lack a theoretical foundation and standardized evaluation criteria. In
response, this work presents a framework called ``Model Privacy'', providing a
foundation for comprehensively analyzing model stealing attacks and defenses.
We establish a rigorous formulation for the threat model and objectives,
propose methods to quantify the goodness of attack and defense strategies, and
analyze the fundamental tradeoffs between utility and privacy in ML models. Our
developed theory offers valuable insights into enhancing the security of ML
models, especially highlighting the importance of the attack-specific structure
of perturbations for effective defenses. We demonstrate the application of
model privacy from the defender's perspective through various learning
scenarios. Extensive experiments corroborate the insights and the effectiveness
of defense mechanisms developed under the proposed framework.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> An increasing number of companies have begun providing services that leverage
cloud-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. However, this
development raises substantial privacy concerns, as users' prompts are
transmitted to and processed by the model providers. Among the various privacy
protection methods for LLMs, those implemented during the pre-training and
fine-tuning phrases fail to mitigate the privacy risks associated with the
remote use of cloud-based LLMs by users. On the other hand, methods applied
during the inference phrase are primarily effective in scenarios where the
LLM's inference does not rely on privacy-sensitive information. In this paper,
we outline the process of remote user interaction with LLMs and, for the first
time, propose a detailed definition of a general pseudonymization framework
applicable to cloud-based LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework strikes an optimal balance between privacy protection and
utility. The code for our method is available to the public at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR,
VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for
human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models
(VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing,
raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive
vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability.
This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that
transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless
integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M
parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data
privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across
14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets
and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated
through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic
parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model
(<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus
enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p>

suffer from disabling hearing loss, with approximately 34 million of these
being children. Hearing aids (HA) and cochlear implants (CI) have become
indispensable tools for restoring hearing and enhancing the quality of life for
individuals with hearing impairments. Clinical research and consumer studies
indicate that users of HAs and CIs report significant improvements in their
daily lives, including enhanced communication abilities and social engagement
and reduced psychological stress. Modern auditory prosthetic devices are more
advanced and interconnected with digital networks to add functionality, such as
streaming audio directly from smartphones and other devices, remote adjustments
by audiologists, integration with smart home systems, and access to artificial
intelligence-driven sound enhancement features. With this interconnectivity,
issues surrounding data privacy and security have become increasingly
pertinent. There is limited research on the usability perceptions of current HA
and CI models from the perspective of end-users. In addition, no studies have
investigated consumer mental models during the purchasing process, particularly
which factors they prioritize when selecting a device. In this study, we
assessed participants' satisfaction levels with various features of their
auditory prostheses. This work contributes to the field by addressing gaps in
user perceptions of HA and CI usability, identifying key factors in consumer

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Label differential privacy (DP) is designed for learning problems involving
private labels and public features. While various methods have been proposed
for learning under label DP, the theoretical limits remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of learning with label DP
in both local and central models for both classification and regression tasks,
characterized by minimax convergence rates. We establish lower bounds by
converting each task into a multiple hypothesis testing problem and bounding
the test error. Additionally, we develop algorithms that yield matching upper
bounds. Our results demonstrate that under label local DP (LDP), the risk has a
significantly faster convergence rate than that under full LDP, i.e. protecting
both features and labels, indicating the advantages of relaxing the DP
definition to focus solely on labels. In contrast, under the label central DP
(CDP), the risk is only reduced by a constant factor compared to full DP,
indicating that the relaxation of CDP only has limited benefits on the
performance.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfang Zhao</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Traditional approaches to vector similarity search over encrypted data rely
on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to enable computation without decryption.
However, the substantial computational overhead of FHE makes it impractical for
large-scale real-time applications. This work explores a more efficient
alternative: using additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) for
privacy-preserving similarity search. We consider scenarios where either the
query vector or the database vectors remain encrypted, a setting that
frequently arises in applications such as confidential recommender systems and
secure federated learning. While AHE only supports addition and scalar
multiplication, we show that it is sufficient to compute inner product
similarity--one of the most widely used similarity measures in vector
retrieval. Compared to FHE-based solutions, our approach significantly reduces
computational overhead by avoiding ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications and
bootstrapping, while still preserving correctness and privacy. We present an
efficient algorithm for encrypted similarity search under AHE and analyze its
error growth and security implications. Our method provides a scalable and
practical solution for privacy-preserving vector search in real-world machine
learning applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study a setting of collecting and learning from private data distributed
across end users. In the shuffled model of differential privacy, the end users
partially protect their data locally before sharing it, and their data is also
anonymized during its collection to enhance privacy. This model has recently
become a prominent alternative to central DP, which requires full trust in a
central data curator, and local DP, where fully local data protection takes a
steep toll on downstream accuracy.
  Our main technical result is a shuffled DP protocol for privately estimating
the kernel density function of a distributed dataset, with accuracy essentially
matching central DP. We use it to privately learn a classifier from the end
user data, by learning a private density function per class. Moreover, we show
that the density function itself can recover the semantic content of its class,
despite having been learned in the absence of any unprotected data. Our
experiments show the favorable downstream performance of our approach, and
highlight key downstream considerations and trade-offs in a practical ML
deployment of shuffled DP.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Synthetic data has garnered attention as a Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET)
in sectors such as healthcare and finance. When using synthetic data in
practical applications, it is important to provide protection guarantees. In
the literature, two family of approaches are proposed for tabular data: on the
one hand, Similarity-based methods aim at finding the level of similarity
between training and synthetic data. Indeed, a privacy breach can occur if the
generated data is consistently too similar or even identical to the train data.
On the other hand, Attack-based methods conduce deliberate attacks on synthetic
datasets. The success rates of these attacks reveal how secure the synthetic
datasets are.
  In this paper, we introduce a contrastive method that improves privacy
assessment of synthetic datasets by embedding the data in a more representative
space. This overcomes obstacles surrounding the multitude of data types and
attributes. It also makes the use of intuitive distance metrics possible for
similarity measurements and as an attack vector. In a series of experiments
with publicly available datasets, we compare the performances of
similarity-based and attack-based methods, both with and without use of the
contrastive learning-based embeddings. Our results show that relatively
efficient, easy to implement privacy metrics can perform equally well as more
advanced metrics explicitly modeling conditions for privacy referred to by the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> How much information about training samples can be gleaned from synthetic
data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)? Overlooking the subtleties of
information flow in synthetic data generation pipelines can lead to a false
sense of privacy. In this paper, we design membership inference attacks (MIAs)
that target data used to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs that are then used to
synthesize data, particularly when the adversary does not have access to the
fine-tuned model but only to the synthetic data. We show that such data-based
MIAs do significantly better than a random guess, meaning that synthetic data
leaks information about the training data. Further, we find that canaries
crafted to maximize vulnerability to model-based MIAs are sub-optimal for
privacy auditing when only synthetic data is released. Such out-of-distribution
canaries have limited influence on the model's output when prompted to generate
useful, in-distribution synthetic data, which drastically reduces their
vulnerability. To tackle this problem, we leverage the mechanics of
auto-regressive models to design canaries with an in-distribution prefix and a
high-perplexity suffix that leave detectable traces in synthetic data. This
enhances the power of data-based MIAs and provides a better assessment of the
privacy risks of releasing synthetic data generated by LLMs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) is redefining the
landscape of human-computer interaction, and their integration into various
user-service applications is becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
transmitting user data to cloud-based LLMs presents significant risks of data
breaches and unauthorized access to personal identification information. In
this paper, we propose a privacy preservation pipeline for protecting privacy
and sensitive information during interactions between users and LLMs in
practical LLM usage scenarios. We construct SensitiveQA, the first privacy
open-ended question-answering dataset. It comprises 57k interactions in Chinese
and English, encompassing a diverse range of user-sensitive information within
the conversations. Our proposed solution employs a multi-stage strategy aimed
at preemptively securing user information while simultaneously preserving the

method's efficacy in balancing privacy protection with maintaining robust
interaction quality. The code and dataset are available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ act as
auctioneers in a public double auction system, where buyers submit their
highest bids and sellers offer their lowest asking prices, along with the
number of shares (volume) they wish to trade. The auctioneer matches compatible
orders and executes the trades when a match is found. However, auctioneers
involved in high-volume exchanges, such as dark pools, may not always be
reliable. They could exploit their position by engaging in practices like
front-running or face significant conflicts of interest, i.e., ethical breaches
that have frequently resulted in hefty fines and regulatory scrutiny within the
financial industry.
  Previous solutions, based on the use of fully homomorphic encryption (Asharov
et al., AAMAS 2020), encrypt orders ensuring that information is revealed only
when a match occurs. However, this approach introduces significant
computational overhead, making it impractical for high-frequency trading
environments such as dark pools.
  In this work, we propose a new system based on differential privacy combined
with lightweight encryption, offering an efficient and practical solution that
mitigates the risks of an untrustworthy auctioneer. Specifically, we introduce
a new concept called Indifferential Privacy, which can be of independent
interest, where a user is indifferent to whether certain information is
revealed after some special event, unlike standard differential privacy. For
example, in an auction, it's reasonable to disclose the true volume of a trade
once all of it has been matched. Moreover, our new concept of Indifferential
Privacy allows for maximum matching, which is impossible with conventional
differential privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study the inherent trade-offs in minimizing privacy risks and maximizing
utility, while maintaining high computational efficiency, when fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs). A number of recent works in privacy research have
attempted to mitigate privacy risks posed by memorizing fine-tuning data by
using differentially private training methods (e.g., DP), albeit at a
significantly higher computational cost (inefficiency). In parallel, several
works in systems research have focussed on developing (parameter) efficient
fine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA), but few works, if any, investigated whether
such efficient methods enhance or diminish privacy risks. In this paper, we
investigate this gap and arrive at a surprising conclusion: efficient
fine-tuning methods like LoRA mitigate privacy risks similar to private
fine-tuning methods like DP. Our empirical finding directly contradicts
prevailing wisdom that privacy and efficiency objectives are at odds during
fine-tuning. Our finding is established by (a) carefully defining measures of
privacy and utility that distinguish between memorizing sensitive and
non-sensitive tokens in training and test datasets used in fine-tuning and (b)
extensive evaluations using multiple open-source language models from Pythia,
Gemma, and Llama families and different domain-specific datasets.</p>

to protect the privacy of the original training data. In this work, we explore
four different training paradigms: coreset selection, dataset distillation,
data-free knowledge distillation, and synthetic data generated from diffusion
models. While all these methods utilize synthetic data for training, they lead
to vastly different conclusions regarding privacy preservation. We caution that

efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks
remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of
SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an
adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training

to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes
as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy
under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in
SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more
secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that
SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In Federated Deep Learning (FDL), multiple local enterprises are allowed to
train a model jointly. Then, they submit their local updates to the central
server, and the server aggregates the updates to create a global model.
However, trained models usually perform worse than centralized models,
especially when the training data distribution is non-independent and
identically distributed (nonIID). NonIID data harms the accuracy and
performance of the model. Additionally, due to the centrality of federated
learning (FL) and the untrustworthiness of enterprises, traditional FL
solutions are vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. To tackle this issue,
we propose FedAnil, a secure blockchain enabled Federated Deep Learning Model
that improves enterprise models decentralization, performance, and tamper proof
properties, incorporating two main phases. The first phase addresses the nonIID
challenge (label and feature distribution skew). The second phase addresses
security and privacy concerns against poisoning and inference attacks through
three steps. Extensive experiments were conducted using the Sent140,
FashionMNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10 new real world datasets to evaluate FedAnils
robustness and performance. The simulation results demonstrate that FedAnil
satisfies FDL privacy preserving requirements. In terms of convergence
analysis, the model parameter obtained with FedAnil converges to the optimum of
the model parameter. In addition, it performs better in terms of accuracy (more
than 11, 15, and 24%) and computation overhead (less than 8, 10, and 15%)
compared with baseline approaches, namely ShieldFL, RVPFL, and RFA.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks, potentially
leaking training data due to implicit memorization. Existing privacy attacks
primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction
attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII)
in LLM's training data remains challenging. In this paper, we propose R.R.
(Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables
attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII
entities have been masked. In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm
named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in
masks. Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates.
In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and
rank them. Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model
as a calibration to our criterion. Experiments across three popular PII
datasets demonstrate that the R.R. achieves better PII identical performance
compared to baselines. These results highlight the vulnerability of LLMs to PII
leakage even when training data has been scrubbed. We release the replicate
package of R.R. at a link.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large Language Model (LLM) agents have become increasingly prevalent across
various real-world applications. They enhance decision-making by storing
private user-agent interactions in the memory module for demonstrations,
introducing new privacy risks for LLM agents. In this work, we systematically
investigate the vulnerability of LLM agents to our proposed Memory EXTRaction
Attack (MEXTRA) under a black-box setting. To extract private information from
memory, we propose an effective attacking prompt design and an automated prompt
generation method based on different levels of knowledge about the LLM agent.
Experiments on two representative agents demonstrate the effectiveness of
MEXTRA. Moreover, we explore key factors influencing memory leakage from both
the agent's and the attacker's perspectives. Our findings highlight the urgent
need for effective memory safeguards in LLM agent design and deployment.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Strong Differential Privacy (DP) and Optimization guarantees are two
desirable properties for a method in Federated Learning (FL). However, existing
algorithms do not achieve both properties at once: they either have optimal DP
guarantees but rely on restrictive assumptions such as bounded
gradients/bounded data heterogeneity, or they ensure strong optimization
performance but lack DP guarantees. To address this gap in the literature, we
propose and analyze a new method called Clip21-SGD2M based on a novel
combination of clipping, heavy-ball momentum, and Error Feedback. In
particular, for non-convex smooth distributed problems with clients having
arbitrarily heterogeneous data, we prove that Clip21-SGD2M has optimal
convergence rate and also near optimal (local-)DP neighborhood. Our numerical
experiments on non-convex logistic regression and training of neural networks
highlight the superiority of Clip21-SGD2M over baselines in terms of the
optimization performance for a given DP-budget.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Although mobile devices benefit users in their daily lives in numerous ways,
they also raise several privacy concerns. For instance, they can reveal
sensitive information that can be inferred from location data. This location
data is shared through service providers as well as mobile applications.
Understanding how and with whom users share their location data -- as well as
users' perception of the underlying privacy risks --, are important notions to
grasp in order to design usable privacy-enhancing technologies. In this work,
we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of smartphone users'
awareness, perception and self-reported behavior towards location data-sharing
through a survey of n=99 young adult participants (i.e., digital natives). We
compare stated practices with actual behaviors to better understand their
mental models, and survey participants' understanding of privacy risks before
and after the inspection of location traces and the information that can be
inferred therefrom.
  Our empirical results show that participants have risky privacy practices:
about 54% of participants underestimate the number of mobile applications to
which they have granted access to their data, and 33% forget or do not think of
revoking access to their data. Also, by using a demonstrator to perform
inferences from location data, we observe that slightly more than half of
participants (57%) are surprised by the extent of potentially inferred
information, and that 47% intend to reduce access to their data via permissions
as a result of using the demonstrator. Last, a majority of participants have
little knowledge of the tools to better protect themselves, but are nonetheless
willing to follow suggestions to improve privacy (51%). Educating people,
including digital natives, about privacy risks through transparency tools seems
a promising approach.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Model merging is a widespread technology in large language models (LLMs) that
integrates multiple task-specific LLMs into a unified one, enabling the merged
model to inherit the specialized capabilities of these LLMs. Most task-specific
LLMs are sourced from open-source communities and have not undergone rigorous
auditing, potentially imposing risks in model merging. This paper highlights an
overlooked privacy risk: \textit{an unsafe model could compromise the privacy
of other LLMs involved in the model merging.} Specifically, we propose PhiMM, a
privacy attack approach that trains a phishing model capable of stealing
privacy using a crafted privacy phishing instruction dataset. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel model cloaking method that mimics a specialized capability to
conceal attack intent, luring users into merging the phishing model. Once
victims merge the phishing model, the attacker can extract personally
identifiable information (PII) or infer membership information (MI) by querying
the merged model with the phishing instruction. Experimental results show that
merging a phishing model increases the risk of privacy breaches. Compared to
the results before merging, PII leakage increased by 3.9\% and MI leakage
increased by 17.4\% on average. We release the code of PhiMM through a link.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across
various tasks, particularly in recognizing geographic information from images.
However, significant challenges remain, including biases and privacy concerns.
To systematically address these issues in the context of geographic information
recognition, we introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of 1,200 images paired
with detailed geographic metadata. Evaluating four VLMs, we find that while
these models demonstrate the ability to recognize geographic information from
images, achieving up to $53.8\%$ accuracy in city prediction, they exhibit
significant regional biases. Specifically, performance is substantially higher
for economically developed and densely populated regions compared to less
developed ($-12.5\%$) and sparsely populated ($-17.0\%$) areas. Moreover, the
models exhibit regional biases, frequently overpredicting certain locations;
for instance, they consistently predict Sydney for images taken in Australia.
The strong performance of VLMs also raises privacy concerns, particularly for
users who share images online without the intent of being identified. Our code

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Assessing data quality is crucial to knowing whether and how to use the data
for different purposes. Specifically, given a collection of integrity
constraints, various ways have been proposed to quantify the inconsistency of a
database. Inconsistency measures are particularly important when we wish to
assess the quality of private data without revealing sensitive information. We
study the estimation of inconsistency measures for a database protected under
Differential Privacy (DP). Such estimation is nontrivial since some measures
intrinsically query sensitive information, and the computation of others
involves functions on underlying sensitive data. Among five inconsistency
measures that have been proposed in recent work, we identify that two are
intractable in the DP setting. The major challenge for the other three is high
sensitivity: adding or removing one tuple from the dataset may significantly
affect the outcome. To mitigate that, we model the dataset using a conflict
graph and investigate private graph statistics to estimate these measures. The
proposed machinery includes adapting graph-projection techniques with parameter
selection optimizations on the conflict graph and a DP variant of approximate
vertex cover size. We experimentally show that we can effectively compute DP
estimates of the three measures on five real-world datasets with denial
constraints, where the density of the conflict graphs highly varies.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Hu and Mehta (2024) posed an open problem: what is the optimal
instance-dependent rate for the stochastic decision-theoretic online learning
(with $K$ actions and $T$ rounds) under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy?
Before, the best known upper bound and lower bound are $O\left(\frac{\log
K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K\log T}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and
$\Omega\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K}{\varepsilon}\right)$
(where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the gap between the optimal and the second actions).
In this paper, we partially address this open problem by having two new
results. First, we provide an improved upper bound for this problem
$O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$,
where the $T$-dependency has been removed. Second, we introduce the
deterministic setting, a weaker setting of this open problem, where the
received loss vector is deterministic and we can focus on the analysis for
$\varepsilon$ regardless of the sampling error. At the deterministic setting,
we prove upper and lower bounds that match at $\Theta\left(\frac{\log
K}{\varepsilon}\right)$, while a direct application of the analysis and
algorithms from the original setting still leads to an extra log factor.
Technically, we introduce the Bernoulli resampling trick, which enforces a
monotonic property for the output from report-noisy-max mechanism that enables
a tighter analysis. Moreover, by replacing the Laplace noise with Gumbel noise,
we derived explicit integral form that gives a tight characterization of the
regret in the deterministic case.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> DeepFakes pose a significant threat to our society. One representative
DeepFake application is face-swapping, which replaces the identity in a facial
image with that of a victim. Although existing methods partially mitigate these
risks by degrading the quality of swapped images, they often fail to disrupt
the identity transformation effectively. To fill this gap, we propose
FaceSwapGuard (FSG), a novel black-box defense mechanism against deepfake
face-swapping threats. Specifically, FSG introduces imperceptible perturbations
to a user's facial image, disrupting the features extracted by identity
encoders. When shared online, these perturbed images mislead face-swapping
techniques, causing them to generate facial images with identities
significantly different from the original user. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FSG against multiple face-swapping techniques,
reducing the face match rate from 90\% (without defense) to below 10\%. Both
qualitative and quantitative studies further confirm its ability to confuse
human perception, highlighting its practical utility. Additionally, we
investigate key factors that may influence FSG and evaluate its robustness
against various adaptive adversaries.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Online shared content, such as group pictures, often contains information
about multiple users. Developing technical solutions to manage the privacy of
such "co-owned" content is challenging because each co-owner may have different
preferences. Recent technical approaches advocate group-decision mechanisms,
including auctions, to decide as how best to resolve these differences.
However, it is not clear if users would participate in such mechanisms and if
they do, whether they would act altruistically. Understanding the privacy
dynamics is crucial to develop effective mechanisms for privacy-respecting
collaborative systems. Accordingly, this work develops RESOLVE, a privacy
auction game to understand the sharing behavior of users in groups. Our results
of users' playing the game show that i) the users' understanding of individual
vs. group privacy differs significantly; ii) often users fight for their
preferences even at the cost of others' privacy; and iii) at times users
collaborate to fight for the privacy of others.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem has transformed
various sectors but has also introduced significant cybersecurity challenges.
Traditional centralized security methods often struggle to balance privacy
preservation and real-time threat detection in IoT networks. To address these
issues, this study proposes a Federated Learning-Driven Cybersecurity Framework
designed specifically for IoT environments. The framework enables decentralized
data processing by training models locally on edge devices, ensuring data
privacy. Secure aggregation of these locally trained models is achieved using
homomorphic encryption, allowing collaborative learning without exposing
sensitive information.
  The proposed framework utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for anomaly
detection, optimized for resource-constrained IoT networks. Experimental
results demonstrate that the system effectively detects complex cyber threats,
including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, with over 98% accuracy.
Additionally, it improves energy efficiency by reducing resource consumption by
20% compared to centralized approaches.
  This research addresses critical gaps in IoT cybersecurity by integrating
federated learning with advanced threat detection techniques. The framework
offers a scalable and privacy-preserving solution adaptable to various IoT
applications. Future work will explore the integration of blockchain for
transparent model aggregation and quantum-resistant cryptographic methods to
further enhance security in evolving technological landscapes.</p>

where multiple devices or servers collaboratively train a model without sharing

limitation while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we fine-tuned time series
FMs with Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Impedance Cardiography (ICG) data using
different FL techniques. We then examined various scenarios and discussed the
challenges FL faces under different data heterogeneity configurations. Our
empirical results demonstrated that while FL can be effective for fine-tuning
FMs on time series forecasting tasks, its benefits depend on the data

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Genetic data collection has become ubiquitous today. The ability to
meaningfully interpret genetic data has motivated its widespread use, providing
crucial insights into human health and ancestry while driving important public
health initiatives. Easy access to genetic testing has fueled a rapid expansion
of recreational direct-to-consumer offerings. However, the growth of genetic
datasets and their applications has created significant privacy and
discrimination risks, as our understanding of the scientific basis for genetic
traits continues to evolve. In this paper, we organize the uses of genetic data
along four distinct "pillars": clinical practice, research, forensic and
government use, and recreational use. Using our scientific understanding of
genetics, genetic inference methods and their associated risks, and current
public protections, we build a risk assessment framework that identifies key
values that any governance system must preserve. We analyze case studies using
this framework to assess how well existing regulatory frameworks preserve
desired values. Our investigation reveals critical gaps in these frameworks and
identifies specific threats to privacy and personal liberties, particularly
through genetic discrimination. We propose comprehensive policy reforms to: (1)
update the legal definition of genetic data to protect against modern
technological capabilities, (2) expand the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) to cover currently unprotected domains, and (3)
establish a unified regulatory framework under a single governing body to
oversee all applications of genetic data. We conclude with three open questions
about genetic data: the challenges posed by its relational nature, including
consent for relatives and minors; the complexities of international data
transfer; and its potential integration into large language models.</p>

the critical aspect of privacy. In this work, we propose a hybrid ensemble
model that incorporates privacy-preserving techniques to address both detection
accuracy and data protection. Our model combines the strengths of several
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support
Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to create
a robust system capable of identifying network anomalies while ensuring
privacy. The proposed approach integrates advanced preprocessing techniques
that enhance data quality and address the challenges of small sample sizes and
imbalanced datasets. By embedding privacy measures into the model design, our
solution offers a significant advancement over existing methods, ensuring both
enhanced detection performance and strong privacy safeguards.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) allows users to collaboratively train a global
machine learning model by sharing local model only, without exposing their
private data to a central server. This distributed learning is particularly
appealing in scenarios where data privacy is crucial, and it has garnered
substantial attention from both industry and academia. However, studies have
revealed privacy vulnerabilities in FL, where adversaries can potentially infer
sensitive information from the shared model parameters. In this paper, we
present an efficient masking-based secure aggregation scheme utilizing
lightweight cryptographic primitives to mitigate privacy risks. Our scheme
offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it requires only a
single setup phase for the entire FL training session, significantly reducing
communication overhead. Second, it minimizes user-side overhead by eliminating
the need for user-to-user interactions, utilizing an intermediate server layer
and a lightweight key negotiation method. Third, the scheme is highly resilient
to user dropouts, and the users can join at any FL round. Fourth, it can detect
and defend against malicious server activities, including recently discovered
model inconsistency attacks. Finally, our scheme ensures security in both
semi-honest and malicious settings. We provide security analysis to formally
prove the robustness of our approach. Furthermore, we implemented an end-to-end
prototype of our scheme. We conducted comprehensive experiments and
comparisons, which show that it outperforms existing solutions in terms of
communication and computation overhead, functionality, and security.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) builds upon the core principles of
Differential Privacy (DP) by incorporating various distance metrics, which
offer adaptable and context-sensitive privacy guarantees for a wide range of
applications, such as location-based services, text analysis, and image
processing. Since its inception in 2013, mDP has garnered substantial research
attention, advancing theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and practical
implementations. Despite this progress, existing surveys mainly focus on
traditional DP and local DP, and they provide limited coverage of mDP. This
paper provides a comprehensive survey of mDP research from 2013 to 2024,
tracing its development from the foundations of DP. We categorize essential
mechanisms, including Laplace, Exponential, and optimization-based approaches,
and assess their strengths, limitations, and application domains. Additionally,
we highlight key challenges and outline future research directions to encourage
innovation and real-world adoption of mDP. This survey is designed to be a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to deepen their
understanding and drive progress in mDP within the broader privacy ecosystem.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Tool-Based Agent Systems (TBAS) allow Language Models (LMs) to use external
tools for tasks beyond their standalone capabilities, such as searching
websites, booking flights, or making financial transactions. However, these
tools greatly increase the risks of prompt injection attacks, where malicious
content hijacks the LM agent to leak confidential data or trigger harmful
actions. Existing defenses (OpenAI GPTs) require user confirmation before every
tool call, placing onerous burdens on users. We introduce Robust TBAS (RTBAS),
which automatically detects and executes tool calls that preserve integrity and
confidentiality, requiring user confirmation only when these safeguards cannot
be ensured. RTBAS adapts Information Flow Control to the unique challenges
presented by TBAS. We present two novel dependency screeners, using
LM-as-a-judge and attention-based saliency, to overcome these challenges.
Experimental results on the AgentDojo Prompt Injection benchmark show RTBAS
prevents all targeted attacks with only a 2% loss of task utility when under
attack, and further tests confirm its ability to obtain near-oracle performance
on detecting both subtle and direct privacy leaks.</p>

used in $k$ steps randomly and uniformly chosen from a sequence (or set) of $t$
differentially private steps. We demonstrate that the privacy guarantees of
this sampling scheme can be upper bound by the privacy guarantees of the
well-studied independent (or Poisson) subsampling in which each step uses the
user's data with probability $(1+ o(1))k/t $. Further, we provide two
additional analysis techniques that lead to numerical improvements in some
parameter regimes. The case of $k=1$ has been previously studied in the context
of DP-SGD in Balle et al. (2020) and very recently in Chua et al. (2024).
Privacy analysis of Balle et al. (2020) relies on privacy amplification by

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Reconstruction attacks against federated learning (FL) aim to reconstruct
users' samples through users' uploaded gradients. Local differential privacy
(LDP) is regarded as an effective defense against various attacks, including
sample reconstruction in FL, where gradients are clipped and perturbed.
Existing attacks are ineffective in FL with LDP since clipped and perturbed
gradients obliterate most sample information for reconstruction. Besides,
existing attacks embed additional sample information into gradients to improve
the attack effect and cause gradient expansion, leading to a more severe
gradient clipping in FL with LDP. In this paper, we propose a sample
reconstruction attack against LDP-based FL with any target models to
reconstruct victims' sensitive samples to illustrate that FL with LDP is not
flawless. Considering gradient expansion in reconstruction attacks and noise in
LDP, the core of the proposed attack is gradient compression and reconstructed
sample denoising. For gradient compression, an inference structure based on
sample characteristics is presented to reduce redundant gradients against LDP.
For reconstructed sample denoising, we artificially introduce zero gradients to
observe noise distribution and scale confidence interval to filter the noise.
Theoretical proof guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed attack.
Evaluations show that the proposed attack is the only attack that reconstructs
victims' training samples in LDP-based FL and has little impact on the target
model's accuracy. We conclude that LDP-based FL needs further improvements to
defend against sample reconstruction attacks effectively.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy by keeping user data on local
devices. However, emerging attacks have demonstrated that the updates shared by
users during training can reveal significant information about their data. This
has greatly thwart the adoption of FL methods for training robust AI models in
sensitive applications. Differential Privacy (DP) is considered the gold
standard for safeguarding user data. However, DP guarantees are highly
conservative, providing worst-case privacy guarantees. This can result in
overestimating privacy needs, which may compromise the model's accuracy.
Additionally, interpretations of these privacy guarantees have proven to be
challenging in different contexts. This is further exacerbated when other
factors, such as the number of training iterations, data distribution, and
specific application requirements, can add further complexity to this problem.
In this work, we proposed a framework that integrates a human entity as a
privacy practitioner to determine an optimal trade-off between the model's
privacy and utility. Our framework is the first to address the variable memory
requirement of existing DP methods in FL settings, where resource-limited
devices (e.g., cell phones) can participate. To support such settings, we adopt
a recent DP method with fixed memory usage to ensure scalable private FL. We
evaluated our proposed framework by fine-tuning a BERT-based LLM model using
the GLUE dataset (a common approach in literature), leveraging the new
accountant, and employing diverse data partitioning strategies to mimic
real-world conditions. As a result, we achieved stable memory usage, with an
average accuracy reduction of 1.33% for $\epsilon = 10$ and 1.9% for $\epsilon
= 6$, when compared to the state-of-the-art DP accountant which does not
support fixed memory usage.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Distillation (FD) has emerged as a popular federated training
framework, enabling clients to collaboratively train models without sharing
private data. Public Dataset-Assisted Federated Distillation (PDA-FD), which
leverages public datasets for knowledge sharing, has become widely adopted.
Although PDA-FD enhances privacy compared to traditional Federated Learning, we
demonstrate that the use of public datasets still poses significant privacy
risks to clients' private training data. This paper presents the first
comprehensive privacy analysis of PDA-FD in presence of an honest-but-curious
server. We show that the server can exploit clients' inference results on
public datasets to extract two critical types of private information: label
distributions and membership information of the private training dataset. To
quantify these vulnerabilities, we introduce two novel attacks specifically
designed for the PDA-FD setting: a label distribution inference attack and
innovative membership inference methods based on Likelihood Ratio Attack
(LiRA). Through extensive evaluation of three representative PDA-FD frameworks
(FedMD, DS-FL, and Cronus), our attacks achieve state-of-the-art performance,
with label distribution attacks reaching minimal KL-divergence and membership
inference attacks maintaining high True Positive Rates under low False Positive
Rate constraints. Our findings reveal significant privacy risks in current
PDA-FD frameworks and emphasize the need for more robust privacy protection
mechanisms in collaborative learning systems.</p>

Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification for AI-driven PPAs,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) is inherently susceptible to privacy breaches and
poisoning attacks. To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately
devised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust
aggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously
addressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates
poisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to
unencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few
recent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on
impractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's
topology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues,
complicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper
introduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework. DDFed
simultaneously boosts privacy protection and mitigates poisoning attacks,
without introducing new participant roles or disrupting the existing FL
topology. DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption
(FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement
for non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection.
Additionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for
encrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and
feedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent
potential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the
detection process. We conducted extensive experiments on various model
poisoning attacks and FL scenarios, including both cross-device and cross-silo
FL. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DDFed
successfully protects model privacy and effectively defends against model
poisoning threats.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Data-driven advancements significantly contribute to societal progress, yet
they also pose substantial risks to privacy. In this landscape, differential
privacy (DP) has become a cornerstone in privacy preservation efforts. However,
the adequacy of DP in scenarios involving correlated datasets has sometimes
been questioned and multiple studies have hinted at potential vulnerabilities.
In this work, we delve into the nuances of applying DP to correlated datasets
by leveraging the concept of pointwise maximal leakage (PML) for a quantitative
assessment of information leakage. Our investigation reveals that DP's
guarantees can be arbitrarily weak for correlated databases when assessed
through the lens of PML. More precisely, we prove the existence of a pure DP
mechanism with PML levels arbitrarily close to that of a mechanism which
releases individual entries from a database without any perturbation. By
shedding light on the limitations of DP on correlated datasets, our work aims
to foster a deeper understanding of subtle privacy risks and highlight the need
for the development of more effective privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to
diverse scenarios.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As machine learning models become integral to security-sensitive
applications, concerns over data leakage from adversarial attacks continue to
rise. Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by
enabling adversaries to reconstruct training data from model outputs. While MI
attacks on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely studied, Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) remain largely unexplored in this context. Due to their
event-driven and discrete computations, SNNs introduce fundamental differences
in information processing that may offer inherent resistance to such attacks. A
critical yet underexplored aspect of this threat lies in black-box settings,
where attackers operate through queries without direct access to model
parameters or gradients-representing a more realistic adversarial scenario in
deployed systems. This work presents the first study of black-box MI attacks on
SNNs. We adapt a generative adversarial MI framework to the spiking domain by
incorporating rate-based encoding for input transformation and decoding
mechanisms for output interpretation. Our results show that SNNs exhibit
significantly greater resistance to MI attacks than ANNs, as demonstrated by
degraded reconstructions, increased instability in attack convergence, and
overall reduced attack effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics.
Further analysis suggests that the discrete and temporally distributed nature
of SNN decision boundaries disrupts surrogate modeling, limiting the attacker's
ability to approximate the target model.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We analyze the DP (differential privacy) properties of the quantum
recommendation algorithm and the quantum-inspired-classical recommendation
algorithm. We discover that the quantum recommendation algorithm is a privacy
curating mechanism on its own, requiring no external noise, which is different
from traditional differential privacy mechanisms. In our analysis, a novel
perturbation method tailored for SVD (singular value decomposition) and
low-rank matrix approximation problems is introduced. Using the perturbation
method and random matrix theory, we are able to derive that both the quantum
and quantum-inspired-classical algorithms are
$\big(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac 1n\big),\,\,
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac{1}{\min\{m,n\}}\big)\big)$-DP under some
reasonable restrictions, where $m$ and $n$ are numbers of users and products in
the input preference database respectively. Nevertheless, a comparison shows
that the quantum algorithm has better privacy preserving potential than the
classical one.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Within the machine learning community, reconstruction attacks are a principal
concern and have been identified even in federated learning (FL), which was
designed with privacy preservation in mind. In response to these threats, the
privacy community recommends the use of differential privacy (DP) in the
stochastic gradient descent algorithm, termed DP-SGD. However, the
proliferation of variants of DP in recent years\textemdash such as metric
privacy\textemdash has made it challenging to conduct a fair comparison between
different mechanisms due to the different meanings of the privacy parameters
$\epsilon$ and $\delta$ across different variants. Thus, interpreting the
practical implications of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ in the FL context and amongst
variants of DP remains ambiguous. In this paper, we lay a foundational
framework for comparing mechanisms with differing notions of privacy
guarantees, namely $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and metric privacy. We provide two
foundational means of comparison: firstly, via the well-established
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantees, made possible through the R\'enyi
differential privacy framework; and secondly, via Bayes' capacity, which we
identify as an appropriate measure for reconstruction threats.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This article describes how technical infrastructure developed by the
nonprofit OpenMined enables external scrutiny of AI systems without
compromising sensitive information.
  Independent external scrutiny of AI systems provides crucial transparency
into AI development, so it should be an integral component of any approach to
AI governance. In practice, external researchers have struggled to gain access
to AI systems because of AI companies' legitimate concerns about security,
privacy, and intellectual property.
  But now, privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) have reached a new level of
maturity: end-to-end technical infrastructure developed by OpenMined combines
several PETs into various setups that enable privacy-preserving audits of AI
systems. We showcase two case studies where this infrastructure has been
deployed in real-world governance scenarios: "Understanding Social Media
Recommendation Algorithms with the Christchurch Call" and "Evaluating Frontier
Models with the UK AI Safety Institute." We describe types of scrutiny of AI
systems that could be facilitated by current setups and OpenMined's proposed
future setups.
  We conclude that these innovative approaches deserve further exploration and
support from the AI governance community. Interested policymakers can focus on

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The widespread deployment of deep learning models in privacy-sensitive
domains has amplified concerns regarding privacy risks, particularly those
stemming from gradient leakage during training. Current privacy assessments
primarily rely on post-training attack simulations. However, these methods are
inherently reactive, unable to encompass all potential attack scenarios, and
often based on idealized adversarial assumptions. These limitations underscore
the need for proactive approaches to privacy risk assessment during the
training process. To address this gap, we propose the concept of privacy
tokens, which are derived directly from private gradients during training.
Privacy tokens encapsulate gradient features and, when combined with data
features, offer valuable insights into the extent of private information
leakage from training data, enabling real-time measurement of privacy risks
without relying on adversarial attack simulations. Additionally, we employ
Mutual Information (MI) as a robust metric to quantify the relationship between
training data and gradients, providing precise and continuous assessments of
privacy leakage throughout the training process. Extensive experiments validate
our framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of privacy tokens and MI in
identifying and quantifying privacy risks. This proactive approach marks a
significant advancement in privacy monitoring, promoting the safer deployment
of deep learning models in sensitive applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems for digital identity
management is gaining traction and interest. Countries such as Bhutan have
already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their
citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door
for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity
wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise
questions about individual privacy.
  The purpose of this article is to help SSI solution designers make informed
choices to ensure that the designed solution is privacy-friendly. The
observation is that the range of possible solutions is very broad, from DID and
DID resolution methods to verifiable credential types, publicly available
information (e.g. in a blockchain), type of infrastructure, etc. As a result,
the article proposes (1) to group the elementary building blocks of a SSI
system into 5 structuring layers, (2) to analyze for each layer the privacy
implications of using the chosen building block, and (3) to provide a design
assistance dashboard that gives the complete picture of the SSI, and shows the
interdependencies between architectural choices and technical building blocks,
allowing designers to make informed choices and graphically achieve a SSI
solution that meets their need for privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Image autoregressive (IAR) models have surpassed diffusion models (DMs) in
both image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) and generation speed. However, their
privacy risks remain largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive privacy analysis comparing IARs to DMs. We develop a novel
membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a significantly higher success
rate in detecting training images (TPR@FPR=1%: 86.38% for IARs vs. 4.91% for
DMs). Using this MIA, we perform dataset inference (DI) and find that IARs
require as few as six samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 for
DMs, indicating higher information leakage. Additionally, we extract hundreds
of training images from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our findings highlight
a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in generation quality
and speed, they are significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks. This
suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs, such as per-token probability
modeling using diffusion, could help mitigate IARs' privacy risks. Our code is

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital
occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine
learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such
as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees
of DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting,
since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small,
unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches
for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time
series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series,
and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We
theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured
subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight
event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we
additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised
training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that
amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting
models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Bipartite graphs, formed by two vertex layers, arise as a natural fit for
modeling the relationships between two groups of entities. In bipartite graphs,
common neighborhood computation between two vertices on the same vertex layer
is a basic operator, which is easily solvable in general settings. However, it
inevitably involves releasing the neighborhood information of vertices, posing
a significant privacy risk for users in real-world applications. To protect
edge privacy in bipartite graphs, in this paper, we study the problem of
estimating the number of common neighbors of two vertices on the same layer
under edge local differential privacy (edge LDP). The problem is challenging in
the context of edge LDP since each vertex on the opposite layer of the query
vertices can potentially be a common neighbor. To obtain efficient and accurate
estimates, we propose a multiple-round framework that significantly reduces the
candidate pool of common neighbors and enables the query vertices to construct
unbiased estimators locally. Furthermore, we improve data utility by
incorporating the estimators built from the neighbors of both query vertices
and devise privacy budget allocation optimizations. These improve the
estimator's robustness and consistency, particularly against query vertices
with imbalanced degrees. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived
functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding
neurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the
generalizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy
regulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed)
property of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose
Domain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning
framework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site
settings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement,
decomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data
specificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge
transfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning
module enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We
evaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its
generalizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior
classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an
enhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional
connectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively,
uncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning is a distributed learning technique that allows training a
global model with the participation of different data owners without the need
to share raw data. This architecture is orchestrated by a central server that
aggregates the local models from the clients. This server may be trusted, but
not all nodes in the network. Then, differential privacy (DP) can be used to
privatize the global model by adding noise. However, this may affect
convergence across the rounds of the federated architecture, depending also on
the aggregation strategy employed. In this work, we aim to introduce the notion
of metric-privacy to mitigate the impact of classical server side global-DP on
the convergence of the aggregated model. Metric-privacy is a relaxation of DP,
suitable for domains provided with a notion of distance. We apply it from the
server side by computing a distance for the difference between the local
models. We compare our approach with standard DP by analyzing the impact on six
classical aggregation strategies. The proposed methodology is applied to an
example of medical imaging and different scenarios are simulated across
homogeneous and non-i.i.d clients. Finally, we introduce a novel client
inference attack, where a semi-honest client tries to find whether another
client participated in the training and study how it can be mitigated using DP
and metric-privacy. Our evaluation shows that metric-privacy can increase the
performance of the model compared to standard DP, while offering similar
protection against client inference attacks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Vision classifiers are often trained on proprietary datasets containing
sensitive information, yet the models themselves are frequently shared openly
under the privacy-preserving assumption. Although these models are assumed to
protect sensitive information in their training data, the extent to which this
assumption holds for different architectures remains unexplored. This
assumption is challenged by inversion attacks which attempt to reconstruct
training data from model weights, exposing significant privacy vulnerabilities.
In this study, we systematically evaluate the privacy-preserving properties of
vision classifiers across diverse architectures, including Multi-Layer
Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Vision
Transformers (ViTs). Using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques,
we assess the extent to which these architectures memorize and reveal training
data, quantifying the relative ease of reconstruction across models. Our
analysis highlights how architectural differences, such as input
representation, feature extraction mechanisms, and weight structures, influence
privacy risks. By comparing these architectures, we identify which are more
resilient to inversion attacks and examine the trade-offs between model
performance and privacy preservation, contributing to the development of secure

findings provide actionable insights into the design of secure and

knowledge, this is the first work to provide differential privacy guarantees
for the Bloom filter for membership query problems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Mental illness is a widespread and debilitating condition with substantial
societal and personal costs. Traditional diagnostic and treatment approaches,
such as self-reported questionnaires and psychotherapy sessions, often impose
significant burdens on both patients and clinicians, limiting accessibility and
efficiency. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in
Natural Language Processing and multimodal techniques, hold great potential for
recognizing and addressing conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, privacy
concerns, including the risk of sensitive data leakage from datasets and
trained models, remain a critical barrier to deploying these AI systems in
real-world clinical settings. These challenges are amplified in multimodal
methods, where personal identifiers such as voice and facial data can be
misused. This paper presents a critical and comprehensive study of the privacy
challenges associated with developing and deploying AI models for mental
health. We further prescribe potential solutions, including data anonymization,
synthetic data generation, and privacy-preserving model training, to strengthen
privacy safeguards in practical applications. Additionally, we discuss
evaluation frameworks to assess the privacy-utility trade-offs in these
approaches. By addressing these challenges, our work aims to advance the
development of reliable, privacy-aware AI tools to support clinical
decision-making and improve mental health outcomes.</p>
