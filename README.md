    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing
development of secure and responsible AI systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Model-X knockoff framework offers a model-free variable selection method that
ensures finite sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. However, the
complexity of generating knockoff variables, coupled with the model-free
assumption, presents significant challenges for protecting data privacy in this
context. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for knockoff
inference within the differential privacy paradigm. Our proposed method
guarantees robust privacy protection while preserving the exact FDR control
entailed by the original model-X knockoff procedure. We further conduct power
analysis and establish sufficient conditions under which the noise added for
privacy preservation does not asymptotically compromise power. Through various
applications, we demonstrate that the differential privacy knockoff
(DP-knockoff) method can be effectively utilized to safeguard privacy during
variable selection with FDR control in both low and high dimensional settings.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is a rapidly proliferating e-commerce model,
offering consumers to get the product immediately and defer payments.
Meanwhile, emerging blockchain technologies endow BNPL platforms with digital
currency transactions, allowing BNPL platforms to integrate with digital
wallets. However, the transparency of transactions causes critical privacy
concerns because malicious participants may derive consumers' financial
statuses from on-chain asynchronous payments. Furthermore, the newly created
transactions for deferred payments introduce additional time overheads, which
weaken the scalability of BNPL services. To address these issues, we propose an
efficient and privacy-preserving blockchain-based asynchronous payment scheme
(Epass), which has promising scalability while protecting the privacy of
on-chain consumer transactions. Specifically, Epass leverages locally
verifiable signatures to guarantee the privacy of consumer transactions against
malicious acts. Then, a privacy-preserving asynchronous payment scheme can be
further constructed by leveraging time-release encryption to control trapdoors
of redactable blockchain, reducing time overheads by modifying transactions for
deferred payment. We give formal definitions and security models, generic
structures, and formal proofs for Epass. Extensive comparisons and experimental
analysis show that \textsf{Epass} achieves KB-level communication costs, and
reduces time overhead by more than four times in comparisons with locally
verifiable signatures and Go-Ethereum private test networks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal
sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal
protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains
challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to
produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy
guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during
generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such
models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven
utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method
for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.
(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP
mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess
its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN
- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD
significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the
datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training
stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as
GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without
guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best
non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.
In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal
guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained
use cases.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Modern mix networks improve over Tor and provide stronger privacy guarantees
by robustly obfuscating metadata. As long as a message is routed through at
least one honest mixnode, the privacy of the users involved is safeguarded.
However, the complexity of the mixing mechanisms makes it difficult to estimate
the cumulative privacy erosion occurring over time. This work uses a generative
model trained on mixnet traffic to estimate the loss of privacy when users
communicate persistently over a period of time. We train our large-language
model from scratch on our specialized network traffic ``language'' and then use
it to measure the sender-message unlinkability in various settings (e.g. mixing
strategies, security parameters, observation window). Our findings reveal
notable differences in privacy levels among mix strategies, even when they have
similar mean latencies. In comparison, we demonstrate the limitations of
traditional privacy metrics, such as entropy and log-likelihood, in fully
capturing an adversary's potential to synthesize information from multiple
observations. Finally, we show that larger models exhibit greater sample
efficiency and superior capabilities implying that further advancements in
transformers will consequently enhance the accuracy of model-based privacy
estimates.</p>

  to Synthetic CT Translation in Head and Neck</a></h3>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for
image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise,
limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield
unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT)
generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning
(DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity,
scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent
multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region,
extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial
network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers
in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers,
with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$
HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$,
and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB.
Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable
performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR:
$33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust
generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT
synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for
developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data
sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in
sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is
paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for
quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for
private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational
learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate
in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;
and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially
coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy
amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework
for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a
rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping
scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.
We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of
coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These
contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with
provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over
text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong
utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach. Our code is available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Search engines have vast technical capabilities to retain Internet search
logs for each user and thus present major privacy vulnerabilities to both
individuals and organizations in revealing user intent. Additionally, many of
the web search privacy enhancing tools available today require that the user
trusts a third party, which make confidentiality of user intent even more
challenging. The user is left at the mercy of the third party without the
control over his or her own privacy. In this article, we suggest a user-centric
heuristic, Distortion Search, a web search query privacy methodology that works
by the formation of obfuscated search queries via the permutation of query
keyword categories, and by strategically applying k-anonymised web navigational
clicks on URLs and Ads to generate a distorted user profile and thus providing
specific user intent and query confidentiality. We provide empirical results
via the evaluation of distorted web search queries in terms of retrieved search
results and the resulting web ads from search engines. Preliminary experimental
results indicate that web search query and specific user intent privacy might
be achievable from the user side without the involvement of the search engine
or other third parties.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data
without decryption, allowing a great opportunity for privacy-preserving
computation. In particular, domains such as healthcare, finance, and
government, where data privacy and security are of utmost importance, can
benefit from HE by enabling third-party computation and services on sensitive
data. In other words, HE constitutes the "Holy Grail" of cryptography: data
remains encrypted all the time, being protected while in use.
  HE's security guarantees rely on noise added to data to make relatively
simple problems computationally intractable. This error-centric intrinsic HE
mechanism generates new challenges related to the fault tolerance and
robustness of HE itself: hardware- and software-induced errors during HE
operation can easily evade traditional error detection and correction
mechanisms, resulting in silent data corruption (SDC).
  In this work, we motivate a thorough discussion regarding the sensitivity of
HE applications to bit faults and provide a detailed error characterization
study of CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song). This is one of the most popular HE schemes
due to its fixed-point arithmetic support for AI and machine learning
applications. We also delve into the impact of the residue number system (RNS)
and the number theoretic transform (NTT), two widely adopted HE optimization
techniques, on CKKS' error sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that looks into the robustness and error sensitivity of
homomorphic encryption and, as such, it can pave the way for critical future

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Ratliff, Salil Vadhan</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent works have started to theoretically investigate how we can protect
differentially private programs against timing attacks, by making the joint
distribution the output and the runtime differentially private (JOT-DP).
However, the existing approaches to JOT-DP have some limitations, particularly
in the setting of unbounded DP (which protects the size of the dataset and
applies to arbitrarily large datasets). First, the known conversion of pure DP
programs to pure JOT-DP programs in the unbounded setting (a) incurs a constant
additive increase in error probability (and thus does not provide vanishing
error as $n\to\infty$) (b) produces JOT-DP programs that fail to preserve the
computational efficiency of the original pure DP program and (c) is analyzed in
a toy computational model in which the runtime is defined to be the number of
coin flips. In this work, we overcome these limitations. Specifically, we show
that the error required for pure JOT-DP in the unbounded setting depends on the
model of computation. In a randomized RAM model where the dataset size $n$ is
given (or can be computed in constant time) and we can generate random numbers
(not just random bits) in constant time, polynomially small error probability
is necessary and sufficient. If $n$ is not given or we only have a random-bit
generator, an (arbitrarily small) constant error probability is necessary and
sufficient. The aforementioned positive results are proven by efficient
procedures to convert any pure JOT-DP program $P$ in the upper-bounded setting
to a pure JOT-DP program $P'$ in the unbounded setting, such that the output
distribution of $P'$ is $\gamma$-close in total variation distance to that of
$P$, where $\gamma$ is either an arbitrarily small constant or polynomially
small, depending on the model of computation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning has emerged as a privacy-oriented alternative to
centralized Machine Learning, enabling collaborative model training without
direct data sharing. While extensively studied for neural networks, the
security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored.
This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction
attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried
out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using
split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other
clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient
boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare,
and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a
publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently
reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all
implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it
partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model
performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms
specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide
preliminary insights into their design.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Decentralized optimization is crucial for multi-agent systems, with
significant concerns about communication efficiency and privacy. This paper
explores the role of efficient communication in decentralized stochastic
gradient descent algorithms for enhancing privacy preservation. We develop a
novel algorithm that incorporates two key features: random agent activation and
sparsified communication. Utilizing differential privacy, we demonstrate that
these features reduce noise without sacrificing privacy, thereby amplifying the
privacy guarantee and improving accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the
convergence and the privacy-accuracy-communication trade-off of the proposed
algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results to illustrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Vertical federated learning (VFL) has become a key paradigm for collaborative
machine learning, enabling multiple parties to train models over distributed
feature spaces while preserving data privacy. Despite security protocols that
defend against external attacks - such as gradient masking and encryption,
which prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data - recent label inference
attacks from within the system have emerged. These attacks exploit gradients
and semantic embeddings to reconstruct private labels, bypassing traditional
defenses. For example, the passive label inference attack can reconstruct tens
of thousands of participants' private data using just 40 auxiliary labels,
posing a significant security threat. Existing defenses address single leakage
pathways, such as gradient leakage or label exposure. As attack strategies
evolve, their limitations become clear, especially against hybrid attacks that
combine multiple vectors. To address this, we propose Label-Anonymized Defense
with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified defense framework that integrates
gradient substitution, label anonymization, and anomaly detection. LADSG
mitigates both gradient and label leakage while maintaining the scalability and
efficiency of VFL. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that LADSG
reduces label inference attack success rates by 30-60%, with minimal
computational overhead, underscoring the importance of lightweight defenses in
securing VFL.</p>

owners, primary users, and different bystander groups with regard to smart home
devices like security cameras, smart speakers, and hubs, but little is known
about the privacy views and practices of smart home product teams, particularly
those in non-Western contexts. This paper presents findings from 27

specialists. We examine their privacy perspectives, practices, and risk
mitigation strategies. Our results show that participants emphasized compliance
with Chinese data privacy laws, which typically prioritized national security
over individual privacy rights. China-specific cultural, social, and legal
factors also influenced participants' ethical considerations and attitudes
toward balancing user privacy and security with convenience. Drawing on our
findings, we propose a set of recommendations for smart home product teams,
along with socio-technical and legal interventions to address smart home

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Zhang, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> The Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Privacy framework [1] provides a
powerful instance-based methodology for certifying privacy in complex
data-driven systems. However, existing PAC Privacy algorithms rely on a
Gaussian mutual information upper bound. We show that this is in general too
conservative: the upper bound obtained by these algorithms is tight if and only
if the perturbed mechanism output is jointly Gaussian with independent Gaussian
noise. To address the inefficiency inherent in the Gaussian-based approach, we
introduce Residual PAC Privacy, an f-divergence-based measure that quantifies
the privacy remaining after adversarial inference. When instantiated with
Kullback-Leibler divergence, Residual-PAC Privacy is governed by conditional
entropy. Moreover, we propose Stackelberg Residual-PAC (SR-PAC) privatization
mechanisms for RPAC Privacy, a game-theoretic framework that selects optimal
noise distributions through convex bilevel optimization. Our approach achieves
tight privacy budget utilization for arbitrary data distributions. Moreover, it
naturally composes under repeated mechanisms and provides provable privacy
guarantees with higher statistical efficiency. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that SR-PAC certifies the target privacy budget while consistently
improving utility compared to existing methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Minoritised ethnic people are marginalised in society, and therefore at a
higher risk of adverse online harms, including those arising from the loss of
security and privacy of personal data. Despite this, there has been very little
research focused on minoritised ethnic people's security and privacy concerns,
attitudes, and behaviours. In this work, we provide the results of one of the
first studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's
experiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health,
social housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and
responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44
semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised
ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data
emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their
most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics
to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent
disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was
driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,
influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The
increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people
grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal
information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof,
was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw
on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive,
marginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our

augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative

In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated

through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated

different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recently differential privacy has been used for a number of streaming, data
structure, and dynamic graph problems as a means of hiding the internal
randomness of the data structure, so that multiple possibly adaptive queries
can be made without sacrificing the correctness of the responses. Although
these works use differential privacy to show that for some problems it is
possible to tolerate $T$ queries using $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ copies of a
data structure, such results only apply to numerical estimation problems, and
only return the cost of an optimization problem rather than the solution
itself. In this paper, we investigate the use of differential privacy for
adaptive queries to search problems, which are significantly more challenging
since the responses to queries can reveal much more about the internal
randomness than a single numerical query. We focus on two classical search
problems: nearest neighbor queries and regression with arbitrary turnstile
updates. We identify key parameters to these problems, such as the number of
$c$-approximate near neighbors and the matrix condition number, and use
different differential privacy techniques to design algorithms returning the
solution vector with memory and time depending on these parameters. We give
algorithms for each of these problems that achieve similar tradeoffs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful information handling
capabilities and are widely integrated into chatbot applications. OpenAI
provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending
ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in
November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a
vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers,
instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions
in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users,
unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services
raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of
threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction
leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread
experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are
vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts,
and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround
conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of
defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our
findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable
to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom
GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting
data access behaviors that are unnecessary for their intended functionalities.
Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of
integrating specific defensive strategies in their instructions and highlight
users' concerns about data privacy when using LLM-based applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for
applications in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). In order to mitigate the
privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with
federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research
mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain
gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However,
these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct
the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy
of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a
novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances
rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient
correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and
noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local
gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the
negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the
alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards
convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark
datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy policies inform users about data collection and usage, yet their
complexity limits accessibility for diverse populations. Existing Privacy
Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across
English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose
a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to
mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which
translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving
dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using
domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require
retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across
models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves
GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from
0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without
additional training data. These results highlight the effectiveness of
structured agent collaboration in mitigating dialect biases and underscore the
importance of designing NLP systems that account for linguistic diversity to
ensure equitable access to privacy information.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful
adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce
Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages
the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized
collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory
and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could
achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data
privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the
forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE
synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong
confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay
for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that
trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and
sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized
model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against
reconstruction attacks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In industrial applications, the presence of moving machinery, vehicles, and
personnel, contributes to the dynamic nature of the wireless channel. This time
variability induces channel fading, which can be effectively modeled using a
Markov fading channel (MFC). In this paper, we investigate the problem of
secure state estimation for systems that communicate over a MFC in the presence
of an eavesdropper. The objective is to enable a remote authorized user to
accurately estimate the states of a dynamic system, while considering the
potential interception of the sensor's packet through a wiretap channel. To
prevent information leakage, a novel co-design strategy is established, which
combines a privacy-preserving mechanism with a state estimator. To implement
our encoding scheme, a nonlinear mapping of the innovation is introduced based
on the weighted reconstructed innovation previously received by the legitimate
user. Corresponding to this encoding scheme, we design a recursive
privacy-preserving filtering algorithm to achieve accurate estimation. The
boundedness of estimation error dynamics at the legitimate user's side is
discussed and the divergence of the eavesdropper's estimation error is
analyzed, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our co-design strategy in
ensuring secrecy. Furthermore, a simulation example of a three-tank system is
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
privacy-preserving estimation method.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Membership inference attack (MIA) has become one of the most widely used and
effective methods for evaluating the privacy risks of machine learning models.
These attacks aim to determine whether a specific sample is part of the model's
training set by analyzing the model's output. While traditional membership
inference attacks focus on leveraging the model's posterior output, such as
confidence on the target sample, we propose IMIA, a novel attack strategy that
utilizes the process of generating adversarial samples to infer membership. We
propose to infer the member properties of the target sample using the number of
iterations required to generate its adversarial sample. We conduct experiments
across multiple models and datasets, and our results demonstrate that the
number of iterations for generating an adversarial sample is a reliable feature
for membership inference, achieving strong performance both in black-box and
white-box attack scenarios. This work provides a new perspective for evaluating
model privacy and highlights the potential of adversarial example-based
features for privacy leakage assessment.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper tackles the challenge of achieving Differential Privacy (DP) in
Federated Learning (FL) under partial-participation, where only a subset of the
machines participate in each time-step. While previous work achieved optimal
performance in full-participation settings, these methods struggled to extend
to partial-participation scenarios. Our approach fills this gap by introducing
a novel noise-cancellation mechanism that preserves privacy without sacrificing
convergence rates or computational efficiency. We analyze our method within the
Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) framework and show that it delivers
optimal performance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.
This work expands the applicability of DP in FL, offering an efficient and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Personalized federated learning (PFL) offers a solution to balancing
personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to
guide personalized learning (PL). Little attention has been given to wireless
PFL (WPFL), where privacy concerns arise. Performance fairness of PL models is
another challenge resulting from communication bottlenecks in WPFL. This paper
exploits quantization errors to enhance the privacy of WPFL and proposes a
novel quantization-assisted Gaussian differential privacy (DP) mechanism. We
analyze the convergence upper bounds of individual PL models by considering the
impact of the mechanism (i.e., quantization errors and Gaussian DP noises) and
imperfect communication channels on the FL of WPFL. By minimizing the maximum
of the bounds, we design an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that
yields min-max fairness for WPFL with OFDMA interfaces. This is achieved by
revealing the nested structure of this problem to decouple it into subproblems
solved sequentially for the client selection, channel allocation, and power
control, and for the learning rates and PL-FL weighting coefficients.
Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that our approach
substantially outperforms alternative scheduling strategies by 87.08%, 16.21%,
and 38.37% in accuracy, the maximum test loss of participating clients, and
fairness (Jain's index), respectively.</p>

In this paper, we propose a differentially private integrated statistic for

insights while safeguarding privacy. First, we analyze the global sensitivity
of sample eigenvalues for sub-Gaussian populations, where our method bypasses
the commonly assumed boundedness of data covariates. For sufficiently large
sample size, the privatized statistic guarantees privacy with high probability.
Furthermore, when the ratio of dimension to sample size, $d/n \to y \in (0,
\infty)$, the privatized test is asymptotically distribution-free with
well-known critical values, and detects the local alternative hypotheses
distinct from the null at the fastest rate of $1/\sqrt{n}$. Extensive numerical
studies on synthetic and real data showcase the validity and powerfulness of

poisoning attacks and poses unforeseen threats to the underlying LDP-supported

adversarial activities for our mitigation design. For detection, we present a
new method to precisely identify bogus reports and thus LDP aggregation can be
performed over the ``clean'' data. When the attack behavior becomes stealthy
and direct filtering out malicious users is difficult, we further propose a
detection that can effectively recognize hidden adversarial patterns, thus
facilitating the decision-making of service providers. These detection methods
require no additional data and attack information and incur minimal
computational cost. Our experiment demonstrates their excellent performance and
substantial improvement over previous work in various settings. In addition, we
conduct an empirical analysis of LDP post-processing for corrupted data

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-preserving data publication, including synthetic data sharing, often
experiences trade-offs between privacy and utility. Synthetic data is generally
more effective than data anonymization in balancing this trade-off, however,
not without its own challenges. Synthetic data produced by generative models
trained on source data may inadvertently reveal information about outliers.
Techniques specifically designed for preserving privacy, such as introducing
noise to satisfy differential privacy, often incur unpredictable and
significant losses in utility. In this work we show that, with the right
mechanism of synthetic data generation, we can achieve strong privacy
protection without significant utility loss. Synthetic data generators
producing contracting data patterns, such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE), can enhance a differentially private data generator,
leveraging the strengths of both. We prove in theory and through empirical
demonstration that this SMOTE-DP technique can produce synthetic data that not
only ensures robust privacy protection but maintains utility in downstream
learning tasks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Although federated learning preserves training data within local privacy
domains, the aggregated model parameters may still reveal private
characteristics. This vulnerability stems from clients' limited training data,
which predisposes models to overfitting. Such overfitting enables models to
memorize distinctive patterns from training samples, thereby amplifying the
success probability of privacy attacks like membership inference. To enhance
visual privacy protection in FL, we present CSVAR(Channel-Wise Spatial Image
Shuffling with Variance-Guided Adaptive Region Partitioning), a novel image
shuffling framework to generate obfuscated images for secure data transmission
and each training epoch, addressing both overfitting-induced privacy leaks and
raw image transmission risks. CSVAR adopts region-variance as the metric to
measure visual privacy sensitivity across image regions. Guided by this, CSVAR
adaptively partitions each region into multiple blocks, applying fine-grained
partitioning to privacy-sensitive regions with high region-variances for
enhancing visual privacy protection and coarse-grained partitioning to
privacy-insensitive regions for balancing model utility. In each region, CSVAR
then shuffles between blocks in both the spatial domains and chromatic channels
to hide visual spatial features and disrupt color distribution. Experimental
evaluations conducted on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that CSVAR is
capable of generating visually obfuscated images that exhibit high perceptual
ambiguity to human eyes, simultaneously mitigating the effectiveness of
adversarial data reconstruction attacks and achieving a good trade-off between
visual privacy protection and model utility.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> OpenID Connect (OIDC) enables a user with commercial-off-the-shelf browsers
to log into multiple websites, called relying parties (RPs), by her username
and credential set up in another trusted web system, called the identity
provider (IdP). Identity transformations are proposed in UppreSSO to provide
OIDC-compatible SSO services, preventing both IdP-based login tracing and
RP-based identity linkage. While security and privacy of SSO services in
UppreSSO have been proved, several essential issues of this
identity-transformation approach are not well studied. In this paper, we
comprehensively investigate the approach as below. Firstly, several suggestions
for the efficient integration of identity transformations in OIDC-compatible
SSO are explained. Then, we uncover the relationship between
identity-transformations in SSO and oblivious pseudo-random functions (OPRFs),
and present two variations of the properties required for SSO security as well
as the privacy requirements, to analyze existing OPRF protocols. Finally, new
identity transformations different from those designed in UppreSSO, are
constructed based on OPRFs, satisfying different variations of SSO security
requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to uncover
the relationship between identity transformations in OIDC-compatible
privacy-preserving SSO services and OPRFs, and prove the SSO-related properties
(i.e., key-identifier freeness, RP designation and user identification) of OPRF
protocols, in addition to the basic properties of correctness, obliviousness
and pseudo-randomness.</p>

federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic

by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and

expectations around the safe use of clinical free text and reflect these in the
design of a prototype privacy-risk management tool to support transparent,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Vertical privacy-preserving machine learning (vPPML) enables multiple parties
to train models on their vertically distributed datasets while keeping datasets
private. In vPPML, it is critical to perform the secure dataset join, which
aligns features corresponding to intersection IDs across datasets and forms a
secret-shared and joint training dataset. However, existing methods for this
step could be impractical due to: (1) they are insecure when they expose
intersection IDs; or (2) they rely on a strong trust assumption requiring a
non-colluding auxiliary server; or (3) they are limited to the two-party
setting.
  This paper proposes IDCloak, the first practical secure multi-party dataset
join framework for vPPML that keeps IDs private without a non-colluding
auxiliary server. IDCloak consists of two protocols: (1) a circuit-based
multi-party private set intersection protocol (cmPSI), which obtains
secret-shared flags indicating intersection IDs via an optimized communication
structure combining OKVS and OPRF; (2) a secure multi-party feature alignment
protocol, which obtains the secret-shared and joint dataset using secret-shared
flags, via our proposed efficient secure shuffle protocol. Experiments show
that: (1) compared to the state-of-the-art secure two-party dataset join
framework (iPrivjoin), IDCloak demonstrates higher efficiency in the two-party
setting and comparable performance when the party number increases; (2)
compared to the state-of-the-art cmPSI protocol under honest majority, our
proposed cmPSI protocol provides a stronger security guarantee (dishonest
majority) while improving efficiency by up to $7.78\times$ in time and
$8.73\times$ in communication sizes; (3) our proposed secure shuffle protocol
outperforms the state-of-the-art shuffle protocol by up to $138.34\times$ in
time and $132.13\times$ in communication sizes.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information
embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of
privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information
(PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated
through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the
(sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they
cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if
the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may
still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this
work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy
leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private
information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared
across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a
language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify
privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons.
Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while
language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By
deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced
by 23.3%-31.6%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Designing effective strategies for controlling epidemic spread by vaccination
is an important question in epidemiology, especially in the early stages when
vaccines are limited. This is a challenging question when the contact network
is very heterogeneous, and strategies based on controlling network properties,
such as the degree and spectral radius, have been shown to be effective.
Implementation of such strategies requires detailed information on the contact
structure, which might be sensitive in many applications. Our focus here is on
choosing effective vaccination strategies when the edges are sensitive and
differential privacy guarantees are needed. Our main contributions are
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private algorithms for designing
vaccination strategies by reducing the maximum degree and spectral radius. Our
key technique is a private algorithm for the multi-set multi-cover problem,
which we use for controlling network properties. We evaluate privacy-utility
tradeoffs of our algorithms on multiple synthetic and real-world networks, and
show their effectiveness.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient
data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more
data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a
critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in
applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative
mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search
strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis
spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and
highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and
subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy
budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe
degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented
or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps
disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying
by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these
tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them
entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms,
generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains
inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing,
standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work
toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in
medicine.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training
machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data
locality. However, the privacy of local data is always a pivotal concern and
has received a lot of attention in recent research on the FL regime. Moreover,
the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in the
benchmarks remains a critical bottleneck for rigorous evaluation. In this
paper, we introduce ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset constructed
from the embeddings extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 model. First, we
modify the CIFAR100 dataset into three client-specific variants, considering
three domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random).
Subsequently, we train each client-specific subset of all three variants on the
pre-trained ResNet50 model to save model parameters. In addition to
multi-domain image data, we propose a new hypothesis to define the FL algorithm
that can access the anonymized model parameters to preserve the local privacy
in a more effective manner compared to existing ones. ModelNet is designed to
simulate realistic FL settings by incorporating non-IID data distributions and
client diversity design principles in the mainframe for both conventional and
futuristic graph-driven FL algorithms. The three variants are ModelNet-S,
ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R, which are based on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and
random data settings, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to propose a cross-environment client-specific FL dataset along with the
graph-based variant. Extensive experiments based on domain shifts and
aggregation strategies show the effectiveness of the above variants, making it
a practical benchmark for classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset
and related code are available online.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving
systems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services
at the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The
integration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring
transactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a
decentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such
systems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive
data interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of
information storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges,
we propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies
tailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The
system supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease
detection, and robust data processing and aggregation. It also includes a data
transaction handler and mechanisms for ensuring privacy at the EGs. Moreover, a
resource-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is
proposed for the multiclass classification of arrhythmia, enabling accurate and
real-time analysis of constrained EGs. Furthermore, a secure access scheme is
defined to manage both off-chain and on-chain data sharing and storage. To
validate the proposed model, comprehensive security, performance, and cost
analyses are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the
fine-grained access control scheme.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention to mitigate
security and privacy challenges in traditional cloud-centric machine learning
models specifically in healthcare ecosystems. FL methodologies enable the
training of global models through localized policies, allowing independent
operations at the edge clients' level. Conventional first-order FL approaches
face several challenges in personalized model training due to heterogeneous
non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data of each edge client.
Recently, second-order FL approaches maintain the stability and consistency of
non-iid datasets while improving personalized model training. This study
proposes and develops a verifiable and auditable optimized second-order FL
framework BFEL (blockchain-enhanced federated edge learning) based on optimized
FedCurv for personalized healthcare systems. FedCurv incorporates information
about the importance of each parameter to each client's task (through Fisher
Information Matrix) which helps to preserve client-specific knowledge and
reduce model drift during aggregation. Moreover, it minimizes communication
rounds required to achieve a target precision convergence for each edge client
while effectively managing personalized training on non-iid and heterogeneous
data. The incorporation of Ethereum-based model aggregation ensures trust,
verifiability, and auditability while public key encryption enhances privacy
and security. Experimental results of federated CNNs and MLPs utilizing Mnist,
Cifar-10, and PathMnist demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the
proposed framework.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Zeroth-order optimization has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning
large language models on domain-specific data, particularly under differential
privacy (DP) and memory constraints. While first-order methods have been
extensively studied from a privacy perspective, the privacy analysis and
algorithmic design for zeroth-order methods remain significantly underexplored.
A critical open question concerns hidden-state DP analysis: although convergent
privacy bounds are known for first-order methods, it has remained unclear
whether similar guarantees can be established for zeroth-order methods. In this
work, we provide an affirmative answer by proving a convergent DP bound for
zeroth-order optimization. Our analysis generalizes the celebrated privacy
amplification-by-iteration framework to the setting of smooth loss functions in
zeroth-order optimization. Furthermore, it induces better DP zeroth-order
algorithmic designs that are previously unknown to the literature.</p>

resources, they also require reliable classical communication and computation.
In particular, the secrecy of any quantum key distribution protocol critically
depends on the correct execution of the privacy amplification step. This is a
classical post-processing procedure transforming a partially secret bit string,
known to be somewhat correlated with an adversary, into a shorter bit string
that is close to uniform and independent of the adversary's knowledge. It is
typically implemented using randomness extractors. Standardization efforts in
quantum cryptography have focused on the security of physical devices and
quantum operations. Future efforts should also consider all algorithms used in
classical post-processing, especially in privacy amplification, due to its
critical role in ensuring the final security of the key. We present
randextract, a reference library to test and validate privacy amplification

science and machine learning, with applications spanning computationally

settings, establishing theoretical utility guarantees. Empirically, our methods
improve performance across multiple datasets and, in several cases, reduce

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies,
as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this,
anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little
attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline
for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when
applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's
speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults.
This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and
objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that
existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy,
but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective
study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech
quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.</p>

particularly suited to encryption due to their sensitivity to initial

transformations from compact rules. This work establishes a paradigm for

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving,

diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their
ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac

including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion

open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports
into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the
highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B
with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models
attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the
only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified
cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In recent years, Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) has achieved
impressive recognition accuracy, despite minimal inter-class variations.
However, existing methods heavily rely on instance-level labels, making them
impractical in privacy-sensitive scenarios such as medical image analysis. This
paper aims to enable accurate fine-grained recognition without direct access to
instance labels. To achieve this, we leverage the Learning from Label
Proportions (LLP) paradigm, which requires only bag-level labels for efficient
training. Unlike existing LLP-based methods, our framework explicitly exploits
the hierarchical nature of fine-grained datasets, enabling progressive feature
granularity refinement and improving classification accuracy. We propose
Learning from Hierarchical Fine-Grained Label Proportions (LHFGLP), a framework
that incorporates Unrolled Hierarchical Fine-Grained Sparse Dictionary
Learning, transforming handcrafted iterative approximation into learnable
network optimization. Additionally, our proposed Hierarchical Proportion Loss
provides hierarchical supervision, further enhancing classification
performance. Experiments on three widely-used fine-grained datasets, structured
in a bag-based manner, demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
existing LLP-based methods. We will release our code and datasets to foster
further research in privacy-preserving fine-grained classification.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine
learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL
preserves privacy and security of the client's data by not exchanging it.
However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for
federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this
paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data REadiness) for FL, a
novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR)
standards, metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. Our
framework generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics,
rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are optimally prepared for FL while
preserving privacy. We demonstrate the framework's practical application by
integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across
six diverse datasets, addressing seven different DR issues. The results
illustrate the framework's versatility and effectiveness in ensuring DR across
various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This
approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as
utilizes valuable resources by identifying and addressing data-related issues
before the training phase.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We develop a communication-theoretic framework for privacy-aware and
resilient decision making in cyber-physical systems under misaligned objectives
between the encoder and the decoder. The encoder observes two correlated
signals ($X$,$\theta$) and transmits a finite-rate message $Z$ to aid a
legitimate controller (the decoder) in estimating $X+\theta$, while an
eavesdropper intercepts $Z$ to infer the private parameter $\theta$. Unlike
conventional setups where encoder and decoder share a common MSE objective,
here the encoder minimizes a Lagrangian that balances legitimate control
fidelity and the privacy leakage about $\theta$. In contrast, the decoder's
goal is purely to minimize its own estimation error without regard for privacy.
We analyze fully, partially, and non-revealing strategies that arise from this
conflict, and characterize optimal linear encoders when the rate constraints
are lifted. For finite-rate channels, we employ gradient-based methods to
compute the optimal controllers. Numerical experiments illustrate how tuning
the privacy parameter shapes the trade-off between control performance and
resilience against unauthorized inferences.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Prompt learning is a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained multimodal
language models (MLLMs) to user tasks. Federated prompt personalization (FPP)
is further developed to address data heterogeneity and local overfitting,
however, it exposes personalized prompts - valuable intellectual assets - to
privacy risks like prompt stealing or membership inference attacks.
Widely-adopted techniques like differential privacy add noise to prompts,
whereas degrading personalization performance. We propose SecFPP, a secure FPP
protocol harmonizing generalization, personalization, and privacy guarantees.
SecFPP employs hierarchical prompt adaptation with domain-level and class-level
components to handle multi-granular data imbalance. For privacy, it uses a
novel secret-sharing-based adaptive clustering algorithm for domain-level
adaptation while keeping class-level components private. While theoretically
and empirically secure, SecFPP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under severe
heterogeneity in data distribution. Extensive experiments show it significantly
outperforms both non-private and privacy-preserving baselines, offering a

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates the hallucination problem in
large language models (LLMs) and has proven effective for specific,
personalized applications. However, passing private retrieved documents
directly to LLMs introduces vulnerability to membership inference attacks
(MIAs), which try to determine whether the target datum exists in the private
external database or not. Based on the insight that MIA queries typically
exhibit high similarity to only one target document, we introduce Mirabel, a
similarity-based MIA detection framework designed for the RAG system. With the
proposed Mirabel, we show that simple detect-and-hide strategies can
successfully obfuscate attackers, maintain data utility, and remain
system-agnostic. We experimentally prove its detection and defense against
various state-of-the-art MIA methods and its adaptability to existing private
RAG systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We investigate a new form of (privacy-preserving) inconsistency measurement
for multi-party communication. Intuitively, for two knowledge bases K_A, K_B
(of two agents A, B), our results allow to quantitatively assess the degree of
inconsistency for K_A U K_B without having to reveal the actual contents of the
knowledge bases. Using secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and cryptographic
protocols, we develop two concrete methods for this use-case and show that they
satisfy important properties of SMPC protocols -- notably, input privacy, i.e.,
jointly computing the inconsistency degree without revealing the inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Electronic health records (EHRs) contain richly structured, longitudinal data
essential for predictive modeling, yet stringent privacy regulations (e.g.,
HIPAA, GDPR) often restrict access to individual-level records. We introduce
Query, Don't Train (QDT): a structured-data foundation-model interface enabling
tabular inference via LLM-generated SQL over EHRs. Instead of training on or
accessing individual-level examples, QDT uses a large language model (LLM) as a
schema-aware query planner to generate privacy-compliant SQL queries from a
natural language task description and a test-time input. The model then
extracts summary-level population statistics through these SQL queries and the
LLM performs, chain-of-thought reasoning over the results to make predictions.
This inference-time-only approach (1) eliminates the need for supervised model
training or direct data access, (2) ensures interpretability through symbolic,
auditable queries, (3) naturally handles missing features without imputation or
preprocessing, and (4) effectively manages high-dimensional numerical data to
enhance analytical capabilities. We validate QDT on the task of 30-day hospital
readmission prediction for Type 2 diabetes patients using a MIMIC-style EHR
cohort, achieving F1 = 0.70, which outperforms TabPFN (F1 = 0.68). To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of LLM-driven, privacy-preserving
structured prediction using only schema metadata and aggregate statistics -
offering a scalable, interpretable, and regulation-compliant alternative to
conventional foundation-model pipelines.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The automated generation of radiology reports from chest X-ray images holds
significant promise in enhancing diagnostic workflows while preserving patient
privacy. Traditional centralized approaches often require sensitive data
transfer, posing privacy concerns. To address this, the study proposes a
Multimodal Federated Learning framework for chest X-ray report generation using
the IU-Xray dataset. The system utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the
encoder and GPT-2 as the report generator, enabling decentralized training
without sharing raw data. Three Federated Learning (FL) aggregation strategies:
FedAvg, Krum Aggregation and a novel Loss-aware Federated Averaging (L-FedAvg)
were evaluated. Among these, Krum Aggregation demonstrated superior performance
across lexical and semantic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore
and RaTEScore. The results show that FL can match or surpass centralized models
in generating clinically relevant and semantically rich radiology reports. This
lightweight and privacy-preserving framework paves the way for collaborative
medical AI development without compromising data confidentiality.</p>

high-level privacy objectives to concrete implementations. We also trace the

highlighting shifts from basic anonymity guarantees toward more nuanced
privacy-accountability trade-offs. Finally, we identify open challenges at the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Users often struggle to navigate the privacy / publicity boundary in sharing
images online: they may lack awareness of image privacy risks and/or the
ability to apply effective mitigation strategies. To address this challenge, we
introduce and evaluate Imago Obscura, an AI-powered, image-editing copilot that
enables users to identify and mitigate privacy risks with images they intend to
share. Driven by design requirements from a formative user study with 7
image-editing experts, Imago Obscura enables users to articulate their
image-sharing intent and privacy concerns. The system uses these inputs to
surface contextually pertinent privacy risks, and then recommends and
facilitates application of a suite of obfuscation techniques found to be
effective in prior literature -- e.g., inpainting, blurring, and generative
content replacement. We evaluated Imago Obscura with 15 end-users in a lab

Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which
phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need.
Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different
objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable
information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the
development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions
that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale
multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases.
In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with
cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue
datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at
the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy
information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with
both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive
evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between
current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources
into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy
trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers' volatile energy
power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of
prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe
privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy
trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party
computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To
tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy
trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure
computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline
and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by
leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier
encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both
the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party
computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the
security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the
convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the
encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the
proposed privacy-preserving approach.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral
contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an
increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the
their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the
synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can
play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach
on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile
suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a
near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex
synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a
mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both
communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is
introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To
mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized
multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the
problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome
non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate
Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve
the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness,
optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy
problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also
indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the
hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation
capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating
peak load balancing in the power network.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows,
concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose
TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to
embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic
steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We
introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to
evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a
practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs
via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably
transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over
97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they
maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These
results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are
passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Neural networks are vulnerable to privacy attacks aimed at stealing sensitive
data. The risks can be amplified in a real-world scenario, particularly when
models are trained on limited and biased data. In this work, we investigate the
impact of spurious correlation bias on privacy vulnerability. We introduce
\emph{spurious privacy leakage}, a phenomenon where spurious groups are
significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks than non-spurious groups. We
further show that group privacy disparity increases in tasks with simpler
objectives (e.g. fewer classes) due to the persistence of spurious features.
Surprisingly, we find that reducing spurious correlation using spurious robust
methods does not mitigate spurious privacy leakage. This leads us to introduce
a perspective on privacy disparity based on memorization, where mitigating
spurious correlation does not mitigate the memorization of spurious data, and
therefore, neither the privacy level. Lastly, we compare the privacy of
different model architectures trained with spurious data, demonstrating that,
contrary to prior works, architectural choice can affect privacy outcomes.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant
advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving
differential privacy (DP) in such settings is challenging due to the absence of
a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. In this work,
we present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging
algorithms with additive node-level noise, both with and without secure
summation over each node's direct neighbors. Our main contribution is a new
analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately
characterizes privacy leakage across these scenarios. This framework
significantly improves upon prior analyses, for example, reducing the R\'enyi
DP parameter growth from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of
training rounds. We validate our analysis with numerical results demonstrating
superior DP bounds compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate our
analysis with a logistic regression experiment on MNIST image classification in
a fully decentralized setting, demonstrating utility comparable to central

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm based on
protecting data privacy of devices, which however, can still be broken by
gradient leakage attack via parameter inversion techniques. Differential
privacy (DP) technology reduces the risk of private data leakage by adding
artificial noise to the gradients, but detrimental to the FL utility at the
same time, especially in the scenario where the data is Non-Independent
Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Based on the impact of heterogeneous data on
aggregation performance, this paper proposes a Lightweight Adaptive Privacy
Allocation (LAPA) strategy, which assigns personalized privacy budgets to
devices in each aggregation round without transmitting any additional
information beyond gradients, ensuring both privacy protection and aggregation
efficiency. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm is employed to optimize the transmission power, in order to determine
the optimal timing at which the adaptively attenuated artificial noise aligns
with the communication noise, enabling an effective balance between DP and
system utility. Finally, a reliable aggregation strategy is designed by
integrating communication quality and data distribution characteristics, which
improves aggregation performance while preserving privacy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the personalized noise allocation and dynamic optimization
strategy based on LAPA proposed in this paper enhances convergence performance
while satisfying the privacy requirements of FL.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We present a principled, per-instance approach to quantifying the difficulty
of unlearning via fine-tuning. We begin by sharpening an analysis of noisy
gradient descent for unlearning (Chien et al., 2024), obtaining a better
utility-unlearning tradeoff by replacing worst-case privacy loss bounds with
per-instance privacy losses (Thudi et al., 2024), each of which bounds the
(Renyi) divergence to retraining without an individual data point. To
demonstrate the practical applicability of our theory, we present empirical
results showing that our theoretical predictions are born out both for
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as for standard
fine-tuning without explicit noise. We further demonstrate that per-instance
privacy losses correlate well with several existing data difficulty metrics,
while also identifying harder groups of data points, and introduce novel
evaluation methods based on loss barriers. All together, our findings provide a
foundation for more efficient and adaptive unlearning strategies tailored to
the unique properties of individual data points.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The rise of online social networks, user-gene-rated content, and third-party
apps made data sharing an inevitable trend, driven by both user behavior and
the commercial value of personal information. As service providers amass vast
amounts of data, safeguarding individual privacy has become increasingly
challenging. Privacy threat modeling has emerged as a critical tool for
identifying and mitigating risks, with methodologies such as LINDDUN, xCOMPASS,
and PANOPTIC offering systematic approaches. However, these frameworks
primarily focus on threats arising from interactions between a single user and
system components, often overlooking interdependent privacy (IDP); the
phenomenon where one user's actions affect the privacy of other users and even
non-users. IDP risks are particularly pronounced in third-party applications,
where platform permissions, APIs, and user behavior can lead to unintended and
unconsented data sharing, such as in the Cambridge Analytica case. We argue
that existing threat modeling approaches are limited in exposing IDP-related
threats, potentially underestimating privacy risks. To bridge this gap, we
propose a specialized methodology that explicitly focuses on interdependent
privacy. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we identify IDP-specific
challenges and limitations in current threat modeling frameworks, (ii) we
create IDPA, a threat modeling approach tailored to IDP threats, and (iii) we
validate our approach through a case study on WeChat. We believe that IDPA can
operate effectively on systems other than third-party apps and may motivate
further research on specialized threat modeling.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Traditional methods for raising awareness of privacy protection often fail to
engage users or provide hands-on insights into how privacy vulnerabilities are
exploited. To address this, we incorporate an adversarial mechanic in the
design of the dialogue-based serious game Cracking Aegis. Leveraging LLMs to
simulate natural interactions, the game challenges players to impersonate
characters and extract sensitive information from an AI agent, Aegis. A user
study (n=22) revealed that players employed diverse deceptive linguistic
strategies, including storytelling and emotional rapport, to manipulate Aegis.
After playing, players reported connecting in-game scenarios with real-world
privacy vulnerabilities, such as phishing and impersonation, and expressed
intentions to strengthen privacy control, such as avoiding oversharing personal
information with AI systems. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to
simulate complex relational interactions in serious games, while demonstrating
how an adversarial game strategy provides unique insights for designs for
social good, particularly privacy protection.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Cyberterrorism poses a formidable threat to digital infrastructures, with
increasing reliance on encrypted, decentralized platforms that obscure threat
actor activity. To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks
while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a
Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN
integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic
encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for
cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph
data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central
aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We
implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate
defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark
web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\%
classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client
behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead. Our results
highlight that privacy-preserving GNNs can support large-scale cyber threat
detection without compromising on utility, privacy, or robustness.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in fields such as
finance, education, and governance due to their ability to generate human-like
text and adapt to specialized tasks. However, their widespread adoption raises
critical concerns about data privacy and security, including the risk of
sensitive data exposure.
  In this paper, we propose a security framework to enforce policy compliance
and mitigate risks in LLM interactions. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: (i) LLM-based policy enforcement: a customizable mechanism that
enhances domain-specific detection of sensitive data. (ii) Dynamic policy
customization: real-time policy adaptation and enforcement during user-LLM
interactions to ensure compliance with evolving security requirements. (iii)
Sensitive data anonymization: a format-preserving encryption technique that
protects sensitive information while maintaining contextual integrity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates
security risks while preserving the functional accuracy of LLM-driven tasks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In distributed Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things applications,
the nodes of the system send measurements to a monitor that checks whether
these measurements satisfy given formal specifications. For instance in Urban
Air Mobility, a local traffic authority will be monitoring drone traffic to
evaluate its flow and detect emerging problematic patterns. Certain
applications require both the specification and the measurements to be private
-- i.e. known only to their owners. Examples include traffic monitoring,
testing of integrated circuit designs, and medical monitoring by wearable or
implanted devices. In this paper we propose a protocol that enables
privacy-preserving robustness monitoring. By following our protocol, both
system (e.g. drone) and monitor (e.g. traffic authority) only learn the
robustness of the measured trace w.r.t. the specification. But the system
learns nothing about the formula, and the monitor learns nothing about the
signal monitored. We do this using garbled circuits, for specifications in
Signal Temporal Logic interpreted over timed state sequences. We analyze the
runtime and memory overhead of privacy preservation, the size of the circuits,
and their practicality for three different usage scenarios: design testing,
offline monitoring, and online monitoring of Cyber-Physical Systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a
guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically
relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive
scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed
version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local
differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the
model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a
k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter
privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search
response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves
both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold
directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove
finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under
severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with
predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive
applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries,
regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Numerical data with bounded domains is a common data type in personal
devices, such as wearable sensors. While the collection of such data is
essential for third-party platforms, it raises significant privacy concerns.
Local differential privacy (LDP) has been shown as a framework providing
provable individual privacy, even when the third-party platform is untrusted.
For numerical data with bounded domains, existing state-of-the-art LDP
mechanisms are piecewise-based mechanisms, which are not optimal, leading to
reduced data utility.
  This paper investigates the optimal design of piecewise-based mechanisms to
maximize data utility under LDP. We demonstrate that existing piecewise-based
mechanisms are heuristic forms of the $3$-piecewise mechanism, which is far
from enough to study optimality. We generalize the $3$-piecewise mechanism to
its most general form, i.e. $m$-piecewise mechanism with no pre-defined form of
each piece. Under this form, we derive the closed-form optimal mechanism by
combining analytical proofs and off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Next, we
extend the generalized piecewise-based mechanism to the circular domain (along
with the classical domain), defined on a cyclic range where the distance
between the two endpoints is zero. By incorporating this property, we design
the optimal mechanism for the circular domain, achieving significantly improved
data utility compared with existing mechanisms.
  Our proposed mechanisms guarantee optimal data utility under LDP among all
generalized piecewise-based mechanisms. We show that they also achieve optimal
data utility in two common applications of LDP: distribution estimation and
mean estimation. Theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations prove and
validate the data utility advantages of our proposed mechanisms.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Face recognition is an effective technology for identifying a target person
by facial images. However, sensitive facial images raises privacy concerns.
Although privacy-preserving face recognition is one of potential solutions,
this solution neither fully addresses the privacy concerns nor is efficient
enough. To this end, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving solution for
face recognition, named Pura, which sufficiently protects facial privacy and
supports face recognition over encrypted data efficiently. Specifically, we
propose a privacy-preserving and non-interactive architecture for face
recognition through the threshold Paillier cryptosystem. Additionally, we
carefully design a suite of underlying secure computing protocols to enable
efficient operations of face recognition over encrypted data directly.
Furthermore, we introduce a parallel computing mechanism to enhance the
performance of the proposed secure computing protocols. Privacy analysis
demonstrates that Pura fully safeguards personal facial privacy. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that Pura achieves recognition speeds up to 16 times
faster than the state-of-the-art.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems have become integral to smart
manufacturing, yet their growing connectivity has also exposed them to
significant cybersecurity threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS) often rely on centralized architectures that raise concerns over data
privacy, latency, and single points of failure. In this work, we propose a
novel Federated Learning-Enhanced Blockchain Framework (FL-BCID) for
privacy-preserving intrusion detection tailored for IIoT environments. Our
architecture combines federated learning (FL) to ensure decentralized model
training with blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity, trust, and
tamper resistance across IIoT nodes. We design a lightweight intrusion
detection model collaboratively trained using FL across edge devices without
exposing sensitive data. A smart contract-enabled blockchain system records
model updates and anomaly scores to establish accountability. Experimental
evaluations using the ToN-IoT and N-BaIoT datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our framework, achieving 97.3% accuracy while reducing
communication overhead by 41% compared to baseline centralized methods. Our
approach ensures privacy, scalability, and robustness-critical for secure
industrial operations. The proposed FL-BCID system provides a promising
solution for enhancing trust and privacy in modern IIoT security architectures.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate
(CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction.
This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user
privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face
obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion
data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data
clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables
collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the
advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components:
(1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level
gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce
communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model
under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite
privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on
industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC
performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying
with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This
framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance
CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is susceptible to privacy attacks, such as data
reconstruction attacks, in which a semi-honest server or a malicious client
infers information about other clients' datasets from their model updates or
gradients. To enhance the privacy of FL, recent studies combined Multi-Key
Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE) and FL, making it possible to aggregate the
encrypted model updates using different keys without having to decrypt them.
Despite the privacy guarantees of MKHE, existing approaches are not well-suited
for real-world deployment due to their high computation and communication
overhead. We propose MASER, an efficient MKHE-based Privacy-Preserving FL
framework that combines consensus-based model pruning and slicing techniques to
reduce this overhead. Our experimental results show that MASER is 3.03 to 8.29
times more efficient than existing MKHE-based FL approaches in terms of
computation and communication overhead while maintaining comparable
classification accuracy to standard FL algorithms. Compared to a vanilla FL
algorithm, the overhead of MASER is only 1.48 to 5 times higher, striking a
good balance between privacy, accuracy, and efficiency in both IID and non-IID

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also
introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies
often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios.
Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which
limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy
standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these
gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance
problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI
framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR,
EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with
a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while
enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive

legal compliance (achieving a +17.64% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy
benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For
OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and
consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by
the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among
institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could
alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns
about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work
aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated

radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified
communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support
communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or
distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the
centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source
frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where
participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer
communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been fueled by large
scale training corpora drawn from diverse sources such as websites, news
articles, and books. These datasets often contain explicit user information,
such as person names and addresses, that LLMs may unintentionally reproduce in
their generated outputs. Beyond such explicit content, LLMs can also leak
identity revealing cues through implicit signals such as distinctive writing
styles, raising significant concerns about authorship privacy. There are three
major automated tasks in authorship privacy, namely authorship obfuscation
(AO), authorship mimicking (AM), and authorship verification (AV). Prior
research has studied AO, AM, and AV independently. However, their interplays
remain under explored, which leaves a major research gap, especially in the era
of LLMs, where they are profoundly shaping how we curate and share user
generated content, and the distinction between machine generated and human
authored text is also increasingly blurred. This work then presents the first
unified framework for analyzing the dynamic relationships among LLM enabled AO,
AM, and AV in the context of authorship privacy. We quantify how they interact
with each other to transform human authored text, examining effects at a single
point in time and iteratively over time. We also examine the role of
demographic metadata, such as gender, academic background, in modulating their
