    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy concerns and fears of unauthorized access in smart home devices often
stem from misunderstandings about how data is collected, used, and protected.
This study explores how AI-powered tools can offer innovative privacy
protections through clear, personalized, and contextual support to users.
Through 23 in-depth interviews with users, AI developers, designers, and
regulators, and using Grounded Theory analysis, we identified two key themes:
Aspirations for AI-Enhanced Privacy - how users perceive AI's potential to
empower them, address power imbalances, and improve ease of use- and AI
Ethical, Security, and Regulatory Considerations-challenges in strengthening
data security, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting ethical AI
practices. Our findings contribute to the field by uncovering user aspirations
for AI-driven privacy solutions, identifying key security and ethical
challenges, and providing actionable recommendations for all stakeholders,
particularly targeting smart device designers and AI developers, to guide the
co-design of AI tools that enhance privacy protection in smart home devices. By
bridging the gap between user expectations, AI capabilities, and regulatory
frameworks, this work offers practical insights for shaping the future of
privacy-conscious AI integration in smart homes.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning models used for distributed architectures consisting of
servers and clients require large amounts of data to achieve high accuracy.
Data obtained from clients are collected on a central server for model
training. However, storing data on a central server raises concerns about
security and privacy. To address this issue, a federated learning architecture
has been proposed. In federated learning, each client trains a local model
using its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the
central server. The server then combines the received models using federated
aggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is
distributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical
manner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security,
certain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the
obtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data
leakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the
aforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was
conducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA)
algorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy
was implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the
trade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon
values. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class
prediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of
privacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between
security and performance must be carefully considered.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) faces a critical dilemma: existing protection
mechanisms like differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE)
enforce a rigid trade-off, forcing a choice between model utility and
computational efficiency. This lack of flexibility hinders the practical
implementation. To address this, we introduce ParaAegis, a parallel protection
framework designed to give practitioners flexible control over the
privacy-utility-efficiency balance. Our core innovation is a strategic model
partitioning scheme. By applying lightweight DP to the less critical, low norm
portion of the model while protecting the remainder with HE, we create a
tunable system. A distributed voting mechanism ensures consensus on this
partitioning. Theoretical analysis confirms the adjustments between efficiency
and utility with the same privacy. Crucially, the experimental results
demonstrate that by adjusting the hyperparameters, our method enables flexible
prioritization between model accuracy and training time.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language
understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential
exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of
information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information
embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction
framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy
guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to
ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring
any fine-tuning of the underlying models.The proposed method performs inference
on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions.
This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while
maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending
operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance
utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it
a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining
high utility.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanka Nanayakkara, Elena Ghazi, Salil Vadhan</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) -- a principled approach to producing statistical
data products with strong, mathematically provable privacy guarantees for the
individuals in the underlying dataset -- has seen substantial adoption in
practice over the past decade. Applying DP requires making several
implementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or
utility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP
deployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing
repository ("registry") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently
started to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by
(1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP
deployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act
as a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP
deployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments
and (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to
understand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and
opportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were
enthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior
deployments and making future deployments. They also identified several
opportunities for the registry, including that it can become a "hub" for the
community and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams).
At the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining
adoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation
choices public and moderating the quality of entries. Based on our findings, we
offer recommendations for encouraging adoption and increasing the registry's
value not only to DP practitioners, but also to policymakers, data users, and
data subjects.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> User-generated content, such as photos, comprises the majority of online
media content and drives engagement due to the human ability to process visual
information quickly. Consequently, many online platforms are designed for
sharing visual content, with billions of photos posted daily. However, photos
often reveal more than they intended through visible and contextual cues,
leading to privacy risks. Previous studies typically treat privacy as a
property of the entire image, overlooking individual objects that may carry
varying privacy risks and influence how users perceive it. We address this gap
with a mixed-methods study (n = 92) to understand how users evaluate the
privacy of images containing multiple sensitive objects. Our results reveal
mental models and nuanced patterns that uncover how granular details, such as
photo-capturing context and co-presence of other objects, affect privacy
perceptions. These novel insights could enable personalized, context-aware
privacy protection designs on social media and future technologies.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.</p>

the computation and communitation burden of the VSS-based DPML schemes are
still two serious challenges. Although Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) system
has been brought to guarantee the consistency and improve the efficiency of the
existing VSS-based DPML schemes recently, we explore an Adaptive Share Delay
Provision (ASDP) strategy, and launch an ASDP-based Customized Model Poisoning
Attack (ACuMPA) for certain participants in this paper. We theoretically
analyzed why the ASDP strategy and the ACuMPA algorithm works to the existing
schemes. Next, we propose an [E]fficient [By]zantine [F]ault [T]olerant-based

While DP experts can implement correct DP analyses through a few prompts,
novices struggle to articulate their requirements in prompts and lack the

DPCheatSheet, an instructional tool that helps novices implement DP using LLMs.
DPCheatSheet combines two learning concepts: it annotates an expert's workflow
with LLMs as a worked example to bridge the expert mindset to novices, and it
presents five common mistakes in LLM-based DP code generation as erroneous

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining increasing interest due to their
potential to detect complex patterns in data by leveraging uniquely quantum
phenomena. This makes them particularly promising for biomedical applications.
In these applications and in other contexts, increasing statistical power often
requires aggregating data from multiple participants. However, sharing data,
especially sensitive information like personal genomic sequences, raises
significant privacy concerns. Quantum federated learning offers a way to
collaboratively train QNN models without exposing private data. However, it
faces major limitations, including high communication overhead and the need to
retrain models when the task is modified. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a privacy-preserving QNN training scheme that utilizes mixed quantum
states to encode ensembles of data. This approach allows for the secure sharing
of statistical information while safeguarding individual data points. QNNs can
be trained directly on these mixed states, eliminating the need to access raw
data. Building on this foundation, we introduce protocols supporting
multi-party collaborative QNN training applicable across diverse domains. Our
approach enables secure QNN training with only a single round of communication
per participant, provides high training speed and offers task generality, i.e.,
new analyses can be conducted without reacquiring information from
participants. We present the theoretical foundation of our scheme's utility and
privacy protections, which prevent the recovery of individual data points and
resist membership inference attacks as measured by differential privacy. We
then validate its effectiveness on three different datasets with a focus on
genomic studies with an indication of how it can used in other domains without

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A smart city is essential for sustainable urban development. In addition to
citizen engagement, a smart city enables connected infrastructure, data-driven
decision making and smart mobility. For most of these features, network data
plays a critical role, particularly from public Wi-Fi infrastructures, where
cities can benefit from optimized services such as public transport management
and the safety and efficiency of large events. One of the biggest concerns in
developing a smart city is using secure and private data. This is particularly
relevant in the case of Wi-Fi network data, where sensitive information can be
collected. This paper specifically addresses the problem of sharing secure data
to enhance the quality of the Wi-Fi network in a city. Despite the high
importance of this type of data, related work focuses on improving the safety
of mobility patterns, targeting only the protection of MAC addresses. On the
opposite side, we provide a practical methodology for safeguarding all
attributes in real Wi-Fi network data. This study was developed in
collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of legal experts, data custodians
and technical privacy specialists, resulting in high-quality data. On top of
that, we show how to integrate the legal considerations for secure data
sharing. Our approach promotes data-driven innovation and privacy awareness in

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Can a distributed network of quantum sensors estimate a global parameter
while protecting every locally encoded value? We answer this question
affirmatively by introducing and analysing a protocol for distributed quantum
sensing in the continuous-variable regime. We consider a multipartite network
in which each node encodes a local phase into a shared entangled Gaussian
state. We show that the average phase can be estimated with high precision,
exhibiting Heisenberg scaling in the total photon number, while individual
phases are inaccessible. Although complete privacy - where all other
combinations of phases remain entirely hidden - is unattainable for finite
squeezing in multi-party settings, it emerges in the large-squeezing limit. We
further investigate the impact of displacements and optical losses, revealing
trade-offs between estimation accuracy and privacy. Finally, we benchmark the
protocol against other continuous-variable resource states.</p>

of their local pairwise weight matrices, which are considered sensitive data in
MAS. Protecting these matrices effectively safeguards each agent's private cost
function and control preferences. Our solution injects consensus
error-dependent Laplace noise into the communicated state information and
employs a carefully designed time-dependent scaling factor in the local cost
functions. {This approach guarantees bounded consensus and achieves rigorous
$\epsilon$-differential privacy for the weight matrices without relying on
specific noise distribution assumptions.} Additionally, we analytically
characterize the trade-off between consensus accuracy and privacy level,
offering clear guidelines on how to enhance consensus performance through
appropriate scaling of the LQR weight matrices and the privacy budget.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, thus preserving privacy. However,
the system remains vulnerable to privacy leakage from gradient updates and
Byzantine attacks from malicious clients. Existing solutions face a critical
trade-off among privacy preservation, Byzantine robustness, and computational
efficiency. We propose a novel scheme that effectively balances these competing
objectives by integrating homomorphic encryption with dimension compression
based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transformation. Our approach employs a
dual-server architecture that enables secure Byzantine defense in the
ciphertext domain while dramatically reducing computational overhead through
gradient compression. The dimension compression technique preserves the
geometric relationships necessary for Byzantine defence while reducing
computation complexity from $O(dn)$ to $O(kn)$ cryptographic operations, where
$k \ll d$. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our
approach maintains model accuracy comparable to non-private FL while
effectively defending against Byzantine clients comprising up to $40\%$ of the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks with multi-hop communication, Road
Side Units (RSUs) intend to gather location data from the vehicles to offer
various location-based services. Although vehicles use the Global Positioning
System (GPS) for navigation, they may refrain from sharing their exact GPS
coordinates to the RSUs due to privacy considerations. Thus, to address the
localization expectations of the RSUs and the privacy concerns of the vehicles,
we introduce a relaxed-privacy model wherein the vehicles share their partial
location information in order to avail the location-based services. To
implement this notion of relaxed-privacy, we propose a low-latency protocol for
spatial-provenance recovery, wherein vehicles use correlated linear Bloom
filters to embed their position information. Our proposed spatial-provenance
recovery process takes into account the resolution of localization, the
underlying ad hoc protocol, and the coverage range of the wireless technology
used by the vehicles. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we present
extensive analysis on the underlying trade-off between relaxed-privacy and the
communication-overhead of the protocol. Finally, using a wireless testbed, we
show that our proposed method requires a few bits in the packet header to
provide security features such as localizing a low-power jammer executing a
denial-of-service attack.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in
machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue
to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence.
This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model
predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat
model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In
particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses
which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an
algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on
protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our
core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that
explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a
certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous
bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms
incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than
pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition
benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional
protection to end users.</p>

  Protection for Subject Faces in Photos</a></h3>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep learning-based face recognition (FR) technology exacerbates privacy
concerns in photo sharing. In response, the research community developed a
suite of anti-FR methods to block identity extraction by unauthorized FR
systems. Benefiting from quasi-imperceptible alteration, perturbation-based
methods are well-suited for privacy protection of subject faces in photos, as
they allow familiar persons to recognize subjects via naked eyes. However, we
reveal that perturbation-based methods provide a false sense of privacy through
theoretical analysis and experimental validation.
  Therefore, new alternative solutions should be found to protect subject
faces. In this paper, we explore synthesis-based methods as a promising
solution, whose challenge is to enable familiar persons to recognize subjects.
To solve the challenge, we present a key insight: In most photo sharing
scenarios, familiar persons recognize subjects through identity perception
rather than meticulous face analysis. Based on the insight, we propose the
first synthesis-based method dedicated to subject faces, i.e., PerceptFace,
which can make identity unextractable yet perceptible. To enhance identity
perception, a new perceptual similarity loss is designed for faces, reducing
the alteration in regions of high sensitivity to human vision.
  As a synthesis-based method, PerceptFace can inherently provide reliable
identity protection. Meanwhile, out of the confine of meticulous face analysis,
PerceptFace focuses on identity perception from a more practical scenario,
which is also enhanced by the designed perceptual similarity loss. Sufficient
experiments show that PerceptFace achieves a superior trade-off between
identity protection and identity perception compared to existing methods. We
provide a public API of PerceptFace and believe that it has great potential to
become a practical anti-FR tool.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure
framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds
to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive
withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We develop
a risk-averse storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming,
explicitly accounting for uncertainty intervals in value function training.
Real-time marginal value function bounds are derived using a rolling-horizon
chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the
bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the
hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds
monotonically decrease with the state of charge (SoC) and increase with
uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors
and SoC-dependent designs. An adjusted storage dispatch algorithm is further
designed using these bounds. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50%
renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance
storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through
improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive
withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an
average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with
higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Jalil Piran, Zhiling Chen, Yang Zhang, Qianyu Zhou, Jiong Tang, Farhad Imani</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Decentralized federated learning faces privacy risks because model updates
can leak data through inference attacks and membership inference, a concern
that grows over many client exchanges. Differential privacy offers principled
protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains
secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box
training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds,
which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an
explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential
privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds
only the difference between the required noise and what has already been
accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal,
and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep
learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private
Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP).
PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID
and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and
operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions,
PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST
while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x
less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80%
with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less
training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to
adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge
environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility,
and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel
Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that
incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application
layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource
management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum
access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue
length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a
secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key
exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to
semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a
partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a
multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy
efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific
service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results
demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines
in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring
robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM), LLM-based agents
exhibit exceptional abilities in understanding and generating natural language,
facilitating human-like collaboration and information transmission in LLM-based
Multi-Agent System (MAS). High-performance LLMs are often hosted on remote
servers in public spaces. When tasks involve privacy data, MAS cannot securely
utilize these LLMs without implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms. To
address this challenge, we propose a General Anonymizing Multi-Agent system
(GAMA), which divides the agents' workspace into private and public spaces and
protects privacy through the anonymizing mechanism. In the private space,
agents handle sensitive data, while in the public space, only anonymized data
is utilized. GAMA incorporates two key modules to mitigate semantic loss caused
by anonymization: Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and
Disproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE). We evaluate GAMA on two public
question-answering datasets: Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle. The
results demonstrate that GAMA has superior performance compared to the
state-of-the-art models. To further assess its privacy-preserving capabilities,
we designed two new datasets: Knowledge Privacy Preservation and Logic Privacy
Preservation. The final results highlight GAMA's exceptional effectiveness in
both task processing and privacy preservation.</p>

little is known about its manifestation in VR environments and its impact on
user privacy. This research investigates deceptive designs in privacy
communication and interaction mechanisms of 12 top-rated VR games and
applications through autoethnographic evaluation of the applications and
thematic analysis of privacy policies. We found that while many deceptive
designs rely on 2D interfaces, some VR-unique features, while not directly
enabling deception, amplified data disclosure behaviors, and obscured actual
data practices. Convoluted privacy policies and manipulative consent practices
further hinder comprehension and increase privacy risks. We also observed
privacy-preserving design strategies and protective considerations in VR
privacy policies. We offer recommendations for ethical VR design that balance
immersive experiences with strong privacy protections, guiding researchers,

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Yang, Rishik Reddy Yesgari, Chengjun Liu</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that
primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules,
and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the
diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy
concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel
privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical
priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.
Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea
manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a
fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red
channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on
diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and
exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning
method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior
performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of
accuracy, recall and F1 score when evaluated using the real-world test data.
The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data and clinical
priors can jointly enable accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems,
especially for privacy sensitive applications in telemedicine and large-scale
screening.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning approach that enables
resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train deep neural networks
(DNNs) by offloading most layers to a central server while keeping in- and
output layers on the client-side. This setup enables SL to leverage server
computation capacities without sharing data, making it highly effective in
resource-constrained environments dealing with sensitive data. However, the
distributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training
process. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors
into the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on
server-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A
significant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients
to correctly execute the defense algorithm.
  We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme.
Through our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense
algorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the
benign nature of locally trained DNN portions. Leveraging the frequency
representation of model partitions enables ZORRO to conduct an in-depth
inspection of the locally trained models in an untrusted environment, ensuring
that each client forwards a benign checkpoint to its succeeding client. In our
extensive evaluation, covering different model architectures as well as various
attack strategies and data scenarios, we show ZORRO's effectiveness, as it
reduces the attack success rate to less than 6\% while causing even for models
storing \numprint{1000000} parameters on the client-side an overhead of less
than 10 seconds.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.</p>

trackers into head-mounted displays could lead to collecting vast amounts of
biometric data, which may allow inference of sensitive user attributes like
health status or sexual preference, posing privacy issues. While previous works
broadly examined privacy concerns about augmented reality, ours is the first to
extensively explore privacy concerns on behavioral data, particularly eye
tracking in augmented reality. We crowdsourced four survey studies in the
United States (n1 = 48, n2 = 525) and Germany (n3 = 48, n4 = 525) to understand
the impact of user attributes, augmented reality devices, use cases, data
practices, and country on privacy concerns. Our findings indicate that
participants are generally concerned about privacy when they know what
inferences can be made based on the collected data. Despite the more prominent
use of smartphones in daily life than augmented reality glasses, we found no
indications of differing privacy concerns depending on the device type. In
addition, our participants are more comfortable when a particular use case
benefits them and less comfortable when other humans can consume their data.
Furthermore, participants in the United States are less concerned about their
privacy than those in Germany. Based on our findings, we provide several

    <p><b>Summary:</b> CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP)
have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference
latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear
model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language
models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and
GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this
compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above
drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model
Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the
client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes
the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The verification of differential privacy algorithms that employ Gaussian
distributions is little understood. This paper tackles the challenge of
verifying such programs by introducing a novel approach to approximating
probability distributions of loop-free programs that sample from both discrete
and continuous distributions with computable probability density functions,
including Gaussian and Laplace. We establish that verifying
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy for these programs is \emph{almost
decidable}, meaning the problem is decidable for all values of $\delta$ except
those in a finite set. Our verification algorithm is based on computing
probabilities to any desired precision by combining integral approximations,
and tail probability bounds. The proposed methods are implemented in the tool,
DipApprox, using the FLINT library for high-precision integral computations,
and incorporate optimizations to enhance scalability. We validate {\ourtool} on
fundamental privacy-preserving algorithms, such as Gaussian variants of the
Sparse Vector Technique and Noisy Max, demonstrating its effectiveness in both
confirming privacy guarantees and detecting violations.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In Pakistan, where dating apps are subject to censorship, Facebook matrimony
groups -- also referred to as marriage groups -- serve as alternative virtual
spaces for members to search for potential life partners. To participate in
these groups, members often share sensitive personal information such as
photos, addresses, and phone numbers, which exposes them to risks such as
fraud, blackmail, and identity theft. To better protect users of Facebook
matrimony groups, we need to understand aspects related to user safety, such as
how users perceive risks, what influences their trust in sharing personal
information, and how they navigate security and privacy concerns when seeking
potential partners online. In this study, through 23 semi-structured
interviews, we explore how Pakistani users of Facebook matrimony groups
perceive and navigate risks of sharing personal information, and how cultural
norms and expectations influence their behavior in these groups.
  We find elevated privacy concerns among participants, leading them to share
limited personal information and creating mistrust among potential partners.
Many also expressed concerns about the authenticity of profiles and major
security risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and social judgment. Our
work highlights the challenges of safely navigating Facebook matrimony groups
in Pakistan and offers recommendations for such as implementing stronger
identity verification by group admins, enforcing stricter cybersecurity laws,
clear platform guidelines to ensure accountability, and technical feature
enhancements -- including restricting screenshots, picture downloads, and
implementing anonymous chats -- to protect user data and build trust.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-preserving blockchain systems are essential for protecting
transaction data, yet they must also provide auditability that enables auditors
to recover participant identities and transaction amounts when warranted.
Existing designs often compromise the independence of auditing and
transactions, introducing extra interactions that undermine usability and
scalability. Moreover, many auditable solutions depend on auditors serving as
validators or recording nodes, which introduces risks to both data security and
system reliability.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose SilentLedger, a privacy-preserving
transaction system with auditing and complete non-interactivity. To support
public verification of authorization, we introduce a renewable anonymous
certificate scheme with formal semantics and a rigorous security model.
SilentLedger further employs traceable transaction mechanisms constructed from
established cryptographic primitives, enabling users to transact without
interaction while allowing auditors to audit solely from on-chain data. We
formally prove security properties including authenticity, anonymity,
confidentiality, and soundness, provide a concrete instantiation, and evaluate
performance under a standard 2-2 transaction model. Our implementation and
benchmarks demonstrate that SilentLedger achieves superior performance compared
with state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) extends the local differential privacy
(LDP) framework to metric spaces, enabling more nuanced privacy protection for
data such as geo-locations. However, existing mDP optimization methods,
particularly those based on linear programming (LP), face scalability
challenges due to the quadratic growth in decision variables. In this paper, we
propose Perturbation via Anchor-based Distributed Approximation (PAnDA), a
scalable two-phase framework for optimizing metric differential privacy (mDP).
To reduce computational overhead, PAnDA allows each user to select a small set
of anchor records, enabling the server to solve a compact linear program over a
reduced domain. We introduce three anchor selection strategies, exponential
decay (PAnDA-e), power-law decay (PAnDA-p), and logistic decay (PAnDA-l), and
establish theoretical guarantees under a relaxed privacy notion called
probabilistic mDP (PmDP). Experiments on real-world geo-location datasets
demonstrate that PAnDA scales to secret domains with up to 5,000 records, two
times larger than prior LP-based methods, while providing theoretical
guarantees for both privacy and utility.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Individuals increasingly face an overwhelming number of tasks and decisions.
To cope with the new reality, there is growing research interest in developing
intelligent agents that can effectively assist people across various aspects of
daily life in a tailored manner, with privacy emerging as a particular area of
application. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for privacy, such as
personalized privacy assistants (PPAs), have the potential to automatically
execute privacy decisions based on users' pre-defined privacy preferences,
sparing them the mental effort and time usually spent on each privacy decision.
This helps ensure that, even when users feel overwhelmed or resigned about
privacy, the decisions made by PPAs still align with their true preferences and
best interests. While research has explored possible designs of such agents,
user and expert perspectives on the acceptability of such AI-driven solutions
remain largely unexplored. In this study, we conducted five focus groups with
domain experts (n = 11) and potential users (n = 26) to uncover key themes
shaping the acceptance of PPAs. Factors influencing the acceptability of AI
assistants for privacy include design elements (such as information sources
used by the agent), external conditions (such as regulation and literacy
education), and systemic conditions (e.g., public or market providers and the
need to avoid monopoly) to PPAs. These findings provide theoretical extensions
to technology acceptance models measuring PPAs, insights on design, and policy

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Streaming data collection is indispensable for stream data analysis, such as
event monitoring. However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy
leaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy
within a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.
Most existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on
homogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose
personalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have
different privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,
we design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy
requirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism
(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data
statistics while achieving $w$-event level $\epsilon$ personalized differential
privacy ( ($w$, $\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution
(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the
same privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the
previous release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$
time slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time
slots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that
both PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation
methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic
data sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget
Distribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error
than BD on average on real data sets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24.9% less
error than BA on average on synthetic data sets.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chang, Mingzhe Chen, Huaxia Wang, Qianqian Zhang</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for
next-generation wireless systems, improving the communication efficiency by
transmitting high-level semantic features. However, reliance on unimodal
representations can degrade reconstruction under poor channel conditions, and
privacy concerns of the semantic information attack also gain increasing
attention. In this work, a privacy-preserving semantic communication framework
is proposed to protect sensitive content of the image data. Leveraging a
vision-language model (VLM), the proposed framework identifies and removes
private content regions from input images prior to transmission. A shared
privacy database enables semantic alignment between the transmitter and
receiver to ensure consistent identification of sensitive entities. At the
receiver, a generative module reconstructs the masked regions using learned
semantic priors and conditioned on the received text embedding. Simulation
results show that generalizes well to unseen image processing tasks, improves
reconstruction quality at the authorized receiver by over 10% using text
embedding, and reduces identity leakage to the eavesdropper by more than 50%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve

SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of

Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable

security and privacy (S&P) challenges due to the unprecedented user
interactions and data collection that traditional paradigms struggle to
mitigate. As the primary architects of XR applications, developers play a
critical role in addressing novel threats. However, to effectively support
developers, we must first understand how they perceive and respond to different
threats. Despite the growing importance of this issue, there is a lack of
in-depth, threat-aware studies that examine XR S&P from the developers'
perspective. To fill this gap, we interviewed 23 professional XR developers
with a focus on emerging threats in XR. Our study addresses two research
questions aiming to uncover existing problems in XR development and identify
actionable paths forward.
  By examining developers' perceptions of S&P threats, we found that: (1) XR
development decisions (e.g., rich sensor data collection, user-generated
content interfaces) are closely tied to and can amplify S&P threats, yet
developers are often unaware of these risks, resulting in cognitive biases in
threat perception; and (2) limitations in existing mitigation methods, combined
with insufficient strategic, technical, and communication support, undermine
developers' motivation, awareness, and ability to effectively address these
threats. Based on these findings, we propose actionable and stakeholder-aware
recommendations to improve XR S&P throughout the XR development process. This
work represents the first effort to undertake a threat-aware,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a standard
method for enforcing privacy in deep learning, typically using the Gaussian
mechanism to perturb gradient updates. However, conventional mechanisms such as
Gaussian and Laplacian noise are parameterized only by variance or scale. This
single degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy
loss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two
factors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition
rounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce
task-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in
noise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy. To address this
limitation, we introduce PLRV-O, a framework that defines a broad search space
of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions, where privacy loss moments are
tightly characterized yet can be optimized more independently with respect to
utility loss. This formulation enables systematic adaptation of noise to
task-specific requirements, including (i) model size, (ii) training duration,
(iii) batch sampling strategies, and (iv) clipping thresholds under both
training and fine-tuning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that PLRV-O
substantially improves utility under strict privacy constraints. On CIFAR-10, a
fine-tuned ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.5, compared
to 83.93% with Gaussian noise. On SST-2, RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy
at epsilon approximately 0.2, versus 50.25% with Gaussian.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Modern vehicles accumulate fragmented lifecycle records across OEMs, owners,
and service centers that are difficult to verify and prone to fraud. We propose
VehiclePassport, a GAIA-X-aligned digital passport anchored on blockchain with
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification.
VehiclePassport immutably commits to manufacturing, telemetry, and service

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a
critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services
handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries
prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection
attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one
service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as
privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence
system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance
boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique
pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and
randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible
fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our
evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94,
significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) combined with local differential privacy (LDP)
enables privacy-preserving model training across decentralized data sources.
However, the decentralized data-management paradigm leaves LDPFL vulnerable to
participants with malicious intent. The robustness of LDPFL protocols,
particularly against model poisoning attacks (MPA), where adversaries inject
malicious updates to disrupt global model convergence, remains insufficiently
studied. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible model poisoning
attack framework tailored for LDPFL settings. Our approach is driven by the
objective of maximizing the global training loss while adhering to local
privacy constraints. To counter robust aggregation mechanisms such as
Multi-Krum and trimmed mean, we develop adaptive attacks that embed carefully
crafted constraints into a reverse training process, enabling evasion of these
defenses. We evaluate our framework across three representative LDPFL
protocols, three benchmark datasets, and two types of deep neural networks.
Additionally, we investigate the influence of data heterogeneity and privacy
budgets on attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
adaptive attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the global model,
revealing critical vulnerabilities and highlighting the need for more robust
LDPFL defense strategies against MPA. Our code is available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning has rapidly expanded from its original inception to now
have a large body of research, several frameworks, and sold in a variety of
commercial offerings. Thus, its security and robustness is of significant
importance. There are many algorithms that provide robustness in the case of
malicious clients. However, the aggregator itself may behave maliciously, for
example, by biasing the model or tampering with the weights to weaken the
models privacy. In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning
protocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators
computation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates. Our
protocol uses a standard secure aggregation technique to protect individual
model updates with a linearly homomorphic authenticator scheme that enables
efficient, privacy-preserving verification of the aggregated result. Our
construction ensures that clients can detect manipulation by the aggregator
while maintaining low computational overhead. We demonstrate that our approach
scales to large models, enabling verification over large neural networks with
millions of parameters.</p>

of datasets under differential privacy in the add-remove model. While
estimation in the swap model has been extensively studied in the literature,
the add-remove model remains less explored and more challenging, as the dataset
size must also be kept private. To address this issue, we develop efficient
mechanisms for variance and covariance estimation based on the \emph{B\'{e}zier
mechanism}, a novel moment-release framework that leverages Bernstein bases. We
prove that our proposed mechanisms are minimax optimal in the high-privacy
regime by establishing new minimax lower bounds. Moreover, beyond worst-case
scenarios, we analyze instance-wise utility and show that the B\'{e}zier-based
estimator consistently achieves better utility compared to alternative
mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the B\'{e}zier

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language
models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of
high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win
market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI
developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models.
Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel
qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy
policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies.
We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to
train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data
indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information
disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and
health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we
examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as
customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies
often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need
for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of
users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data
security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on
children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers
and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered
chatbots.</p>

receives prominent attention from the academia, industry, and government. One
main development over the past decade has been the decentralization of DP,
including local DP and shuffle DP. Despite that decentralized DP heavily relies
on network communications for data collection,we found that: 1) no systematic
study has surveyed the research opportunities at the intersection of networking
and DP; 2) nor have there been significant efforts to develop DP mechanisms
that are explicitly tailored for network environments. In this paper, we seek
to address this gap by initiating a new direction of network-aware DP. We
identified two focus areas where the network research can offer substantive
contributions to the design and deployment of DP, related to network security
and topology. Through this work, we hope to encourage more research that
adapt/optimize DP's deployment in various network environments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Upon integrating Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as the local model, Quantum
Federated Learning (QFL) has recently confronted notable challenges. Firstly,
exploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance.
Secondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable
model transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible
to attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is
vulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states,
since it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This
local noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training,
impairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we
propose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and
introduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the
impact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise
generation scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing
gradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device
noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances
convergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of
intermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection. Using
real-world datasets, we achieved test accuracy of up to 98.47\% for the MNIST

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders
and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant
risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and
increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper
proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking
while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in
interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization,
ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be
integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential
for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious
game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving
framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling
diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting
disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs
based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized
data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we
present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated

first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63%
accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully

their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning

against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing,
impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat
across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering
limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving,
AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam
conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial
intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with
harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model
updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system
produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement
$\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,
safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models
trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement
($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage
($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain
stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing
performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,
MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce
the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the
model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer
and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of
higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify
real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety
moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</p>

remains a widely used standard for data anonymization, mainly due to its
simplicity, regulatory alignment, and preservation of data utility. However,
non-experts often defend k-anonymity on the grounds that, in the absence of
auxiliary information, no known attacks can compromise its protections. In this
work, we refute this claim by introducing Combinatorial Refinement Attacks
(CRA), a new class of privacy attacks targeting k-anonymized datasets produced
using local recoding. This is the first method that does not rely on external
auxiliary information or assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
CRA leverages the utility-optimizing behavior of local recoding anonymization
of ARX, which is a widely used open-source software for anonymizing data in
clinical settings, to formulate a linear program that significantly reduces the
space of plausible sensitive values. To validate our findings, we partnered
with a network of free community health clinics, an environment where (1)
auxiliary information is indeed hard to find due to the population they serve
and (2) open-source k-anonymity solutions are attractive due to regulatory
obligations and limited resources. Our results on real-world clinical microdata
reveal that even in the absence of external information, established
anonymization frameworks do not deliver the promised level of privacy, raising
critical privacy concerns.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems personalize user
experiences across industries but rely on sensitive data, raising privacy
concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a
significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently
handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE
operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse
matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive.
Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical
concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed
Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that
efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing
communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation
accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs,
effectively preserving user privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to
choose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous
differential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user
data and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the
standard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are
allowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an
alternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that
jointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is
robust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize
the guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis
testing perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent
interest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that
there exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior
knowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and
apply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency
estimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to
implement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them
attractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP
mechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sequential change detection is a fundamental problem in statistics and signal
processing, with the CUSUM procedure widely used to achieve minimax detection
delay under a prescribed false-alarm rate when pre- and post-change
distributions are fully known. However, releasing CUSUM statistics and the
corresponding stopping time directly can compromise individual data privacy. We
therefore introduce a differentially private (DP) variant, called DP-CUSUM,
that injects calibrated Laplace noise into both the vanilla CUSUM statistics
and the detection threshold, preserving the recursive simplicity of the
classical CUSUM statistics while ensuring per-sample differential privacy. We
derive closed-form bounds on the average run length to false alarm and on the
worst-case average detection delay, explicitly characterizing the trade-off
among privacy level, false-alarm rate, and detection efficiency. Our
theoretical results imply that under a weak privacy constraint, our proposed
DP-CUSUM procedure achieves the same first-order asymptotic optimality as the
classical, non-private CUSUM procedure. Numerical simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the detection efficiency of our proposed DP-CUSUM under different
privacy constraints, and the results are consistent with our theoretical
findings.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Shuffle DP (Differential Privacy) protocols provide high accuracy and privacy
by introducing a shuffler who randomly shuffles data in a distributed system.
However, most shuffle DP protocols are vulnerable to two attacks: collusion
attacks by the data collector and users and data poisoning attacks. A recent
study addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol,
where users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and
dummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over
categorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain
due to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.
  In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP
protocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME
protocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately
calculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of
interaction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates
within a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to
more advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique
to reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol
provides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy,
and efficiency. We show the effectiveness of our proposals through comparisons
with twelve existing protocols.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such

dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and

large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Web applications are increasingly used in critical domains such as education,
finance, and e-commerce. This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free
performance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is
web form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete
and accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form
fields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually
generating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this,
various tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of
large language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this
task more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as
these models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing
confidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and
breaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving
recommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool
assists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values. This
tool analyzes the HTML structure of forms, detects input types, and extracts
constraints based on each field's type and contextual content, guiding proper
field filling.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As 5G networks gain traction in defense applications, ensuring the privacy
and integrity of the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol is
critical. While 5G AKA improves upon previous generations by concealing
subscriber identities, it remains vulnerable to replay-based synchronization
and linkability threats under realistic adversary models. This paper provides a
unified analysis of the standardized 5G AKA flow, identifying several
vulnerabilities and highlighting how each exploits protocol behavior to
compromise user privacy. To address these risks, we present five lightweight
mitigation strategies. We demonstrate through prototype implementation and
testing that these enhancements strengthen resilience against linkability
attacks with minimal computational and signaling overhead. Among the solutions
studied, those introducing a UE-generated nonce emerge as the most promising,
effectively neutralizing the identified tracking and correlation attacks with
negligible additional overhead. Integrating this extension as an optional
feature to the standard 5G AKA protocol offers a backward-compatible,
low-overhead path toward a more privacy-preserving authentication framework for
both commercial and military 5G deployments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.</p>

health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level
differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace
noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the
server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains
unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine
Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a
parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy
levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly
imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the
frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull
model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across
all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below
fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that
clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training

    <p><b>Summary:</b> It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that
some of this is due to some kind of "black box problem" in AI. I explain how
this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and
actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the
subjects do not know what the system does ("shallow opacity"), 2) the analysts
do not know what the system does ("standard black box opacity"), or 3) the
analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do ("deep opacity"). If the
agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then
these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to
protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give "informed consent", or guarantee
"anonymity". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and
AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude
that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less
effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to
handle this situation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G vehicular networks
promises unprecedented advancements in intelligent transportation systems.
However, offloading LLM computations from vehicles to edge infrastructure poses
significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive user data. This paper
presents a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework for LLM-integrated
vehicular networks. We introduce a hybrid approach combining federated learning
(FL) and differential privacy (DP) techniques to protect user data while
maintaining LLM performance. Our framework includes a privacy-aware task
partitioning algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between local and edge
computation, considering both privacy constraints and system efficiency. We
also propose a secure communication protocol for transmitting model updates and
aggregating results across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves 75\% global accuracy with only a 2-3\% reduction compared
to non-privacy-preserving methods, while maintaining DP guarantees with an
optimal privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 0.8$. The framework shows stable
communication overhead of approximately 2.1MB per round with computation
comprising over 90\% of total processing time, validating its efficiency for
resource-constrained vehicular environments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.</p>

devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant
privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains.
Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they
introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for
anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing
studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information
asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of
informed consent under current regulations.
  We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary
(willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary
(willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a
representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control
trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications.
  On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing
to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data
once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority
remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong
evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and
identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply
characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings,
underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and
consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study two foundational problems in distributed survival analysis:
estimating Cox regression coefficients and cumulative hazard functions, under
federated differential privacy constraints, allowing for heterogeneous
per-sever sample sizes and privacy budgets. To quantify the fundamental cost of
privacy, we derive minimax lower bounds along with matching (up to
poly-logarithmic factors) upper bounds. In particular, to estimate the
cumulative hazard function, we design a private tree-based algorithm for
nonparametric integral estimation. Our results reveal server-level phase
transitions between the private and non-private rates, as well as the reduced
estimation accuracy from imposing privacy constraints on distributed subsets of
data.
  To address scenarios with partially public information, we also consider a
relaxed differential privacy framework and provide a corresponding minimax
analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first treatment of partially public
data in survival analysis, and it establishes a no-gain in accuracy phenomenon.
Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments, with an accompanying R
package FDPCox, validating our theoretical findings. These experiments also
include a fully-interactive algorithm with tighter privacy composition, which
demonstrates improved estimation accuracy.</p>

extensively record various types of personal information. Existing smartphone
agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable performance in automating different tasks. However, as the cost,
these agents are granted substantial access to sensitive users' personal
information during this operation. To gain a thorough understanding of the
privacy awareness of these agents, we present the first large-scale benchmark
encompassing 7,138 scenarios to the best of our knowledge. In addition, for
privacy context in scenarios, we annotate its type (e.g., Account Credentials),
sensitivity level, and location. We then carefully benchmark seven available
mainstream smartphone agents. Our results demonstrate that almost all
benchmarked agents show unsatisfying privacy awareness (RA), with performance
remaining below 60% even with explicit hints. Overall, closed-source agents
show better privacy ability than open-source ones, and Gemini 2.0-flash
achieves the best, achieving an RA of 67%. We also find that the agents'
privacy detection capability is highly related to scenario sensitivity level,
i.e., the scenario with a higher sensitivity level is typically more
identifiable. We hope the findings enlighten the research community to rethink
the unbalanced utility-privacy tradeoff about smartphone agents. Our code and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A membership-inference attack gets the output of a learning algorithm, and a
target individual, and tries to determine whether this individual is a member
of the training data or an independent sample from the same distribution. A
successful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have
some knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,
and this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference
samples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the
attacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample
complexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful
attack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean
estimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian
distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate
$\hat\mu$ up to some error $\mathbb{E}[\|\hat \mu - \mu\|^2_{\Sigma}]\leq
\rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting,
$\Omega(n + n^2 \rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that
competes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that
the attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses
to train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as
all attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples
and cannot benefit from $\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be
underestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may
be possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The increasing deployment of distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems

distributed control frameworks offer scalability and resilience, they also
raise significant privacy concerns due to the need for inter-agent information

algorithm for SoC balancing in a networked BESS. The proposed framework
includes distributed power allocation law that is designed based on two
privacy-preserving distributed estimators, one for the average unit state and
the other for the average desired power. The average unit state estimator is
designed via the state decomposition method without disclosing sensitive
internal states. The proposed power allocation law based on these estimators
ensures asymptotic SoC balancing and global power delivery while safeguarding
agent privacy from external eavesdroppers. The effectiveness and
privacy-preserving properties of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated
through simulation results.</p>

These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside

raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly
concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can

detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and
scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions
simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires
$143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rapid growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) technology, EVs are destined
to shape the future of transportation. The large number of EVs facilitates the
development of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes
bidirectional energy exchanges between EVs and the power grid. This has led to
the setting up of electricity markets that are usually confined to a small
geographical location, often with a small number of participants. Usually,
these markets are manipulated by intermediaries responsible for collecting bids
from prosumers, determining the market-clearing price, incorporating grid
constraints, and accounting for network losses. While centralized models can be
highly efficient, they grant excessive power to the intermediary by allowing
them to gain exclusive access to prosumers \textquotesingle price preferences.
This opens the door to potential market manipulation and raises significant
privacy concerns for users, such as the location of energy providers. This lack
of protection exposes users to potential risks, as untrustworthy servers and
malicious adversaries can exploit this information to infer trading activities
and real identities. This work proposes a secure, decentralized exchange market
built on blockchain technology, utilizing a privacy-preserving Automated Market
Maker (AMM) model to offer open and fair, and equal access to traders, and
mitigates the most common trading-manipulation attacks. Additionally, it
incorporates a scalable architecture based on geographical dynamic sharding,
allowing for efficient resource allocation and improved performance as the
market grows.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy
by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global
model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large
language models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as
their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized
expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP).
This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard
both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we
propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to
obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the
remaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a
privacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each
communication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental
results across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only
maintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also
achieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We analyze the privacy guarantees of the Laplace mechanism releasing the
histogram of a dataset through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML).
While differential privacy is commonly used to quantify the privacy loss, it is
a context-free definition that does not depend on the data distribution. In
contrast, PML enables a more refined analysis by incorporating assumptions
about the data distribution. We show that when the probability of each
histogram bin is bounded away from zero, stronger privacy protection can be
achieved for a fixed level of noise. Our results demonstrate the advantage of
context-aware privacy measures and show that incorporating assumptions about
the data can improve privacy-utility tradeoffs.</p>
