    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated its great potential on medical data
analysis. Large datasets collected from diverse sources and settings are
essential for ML models in healthcare to achieve better accuracy and
generalizability. Sharing data across different healthcare institutions is
challenging because of complex and varying privacy and regulatory requirements.
Hence, it is hard but crucial to allow multiple parties to collaboratively
train an ML model leveraging the private datasets available at each party
without the need for direct sharing of those datasets or compromising the
privacy of the datasets through collaboration. In this paper, we address this
challenge by proposing Decentralized, Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving ML
for Multi-Hospital Data (DeCaPH). It offers the following key benefits: (1) it
allows different parties to collaboratively train an ML model without
transferring their private datasets; (2) it safeguards patient privacy by
limiting the potential privacy leakage arising from any contents shared across
the parties during the training process; and (3) it facilitates the ML model
training without relying on a centralized server. We demonstrate the
generalizability and power of DeCaPH on three distinct tasks using real-world
distributed medical datasets: patient mortality prediction using electronic
health records, cell-type classification using single-cell human genomes, and
pathology identification using chest radiology images. We demonstrate that the
ML models trained with DeCaPH framework have an improved utility-privacy
trade-off, showing it enables the models to have good performance while
preserving the privacy of the training data points. In addition, the ML models
trained with DeCaPH framework in general outperform those trained solely with
the private datasets from individual parties, showing that DeCaPH enhances the
model generalizability.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The problem of estimating a parameter in the drift coefficient is addressed
for $N$ discretely observed independent and identically distributed stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). This is done considering additional constraints,
wherein only public data can be published and used for inference. The concept
of local differential privacy (LDP) is formally introduced for a system of
stochastic differential equations. The objective is to estimate the drift
parameter by proposing a contrast function based on a pseudo-likelihood
approach. A suitably scaled Laplace noise is incorporated to meet the privacy
requirements. Our key findings encompass the derivation of explicit conditions
tied to the privacy level. Under these conditions, we establish the consistency
and asymptotic normality of the associated estimator. Notably, the convergence
rate is intricately linked to the privacy level, and is some situations may be
completely different from the case where privacy constraints are ignored. Our
results hold true as the discretization step approaches zero and the number of
processes $N$ tends to infinity.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper details the privacy and security landscape in today's cloud
ecosystem and identifies that there is a gap in addressing the risks introduced
by machine learning models. As machine learning algorithms continue to evolve
and find applications across diverse domains, the need to categorize and
quantify privacy and security risks becomes increasingly critical. With the
emerging trend of AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), machine learned AI models (or ML
models) are deployed on the cloud by model providers and used by model
consumers. We first survey the AIaaS landscape to document the various kinds of
liabilities that ML models, especially Deep Neural Networks pose and then
introduce a taxonomy to bridge this gap by holistically examining the risks
that creators and consumers of ML models are exposed to and their known
defences till date. Such a structured approach will be beneficial for ML model
providers to create robust solutions. Likewise, ML model consumers will find it
valuable to evaluate such solutions and understand the implications of their
engagement with such services. The proposed taxonomies provide a foundational
basis for solutions in private, secure and robust ML, paving the way for more
transparent and resilient AI systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated recommender systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention for
their potential to protect user's privacy by keeping user privacy data locally
and only communicating model parameters/gradients to the server. Nevertheless,
the currently existing architecture of FedRecs assumes that all users have the
same 0-privacy budget, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server, thus
overlooking those users who are less concerned about privacy and are willing to
upload data to get a better recommendation service. To bridge this gap, this
paper explores a user-governed data contribution federated recommendation
architecture where users are free to take control of whether they share data
and the proportion of data they share to the server. To this end, this paper
presents a cloud-device collaborative graph neural network federated
recommendation model, named CDCGNNFed. It trains user-centric ego graphs
locally, and high-order graphs based on user-shared data in the server in a
collaborative manner via contrastive learning. Furthermore, a graph mending
strategy is utilized to predict missing links in the graph on the server, thus
leveraging the capabilities of graph neural networks over high-order graphs.
Extensive experiments were conducted on two public datasets, and the results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Current implementations of differentially-private (DP) systems either lack
support to track the global privacy budget consumed on a dataset, or fail to
faithfully maintain the state continuity of this budget. We show that failure
to maintain a privacy budget enables an adversary to mount replay, rollback and
fork attacks - obtaining answers to many more queries than what a secure system
would allow. As a result the attacker can reconstruct secret data that DP aims
to protect - even if DP code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We
propose ElephantDP, a system that aims to provide the same guarantees as a
trusted curator in the global DP model would, albeit set in an untrusted
environment. Our system relies on a state continuity module to provide
protection for the privacy budget and a TEE to faithfully execute DP code and
update the budget. To provide security, our protocol makes several design
choices including the content of the persistent state and the order between
budget updates and query answers. We prove that ElephantDP provides liveness
(i.e., the protocol can restart from a correct state and respond to queries as
long as the budget is not exceeded) and DP confidentiality (i.e., an attacker
learns about a dataset as much as it would from interacting with a trusted
curator). Our implementation and evaluation of the protocol use Intel SGX as a
TEE to run the DP code and a network of TEEs to maintain state continuity.
Compared to an insecure baseline, we observe only 1.1-2$\times$ overheads and
lower relative overheads for larger datasets and complex DP queries.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The increased application of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains
requires protecting the training data through privacy frameworks, such as
differential privacy (DP). DP requires to specify a uniform privacy level
$\varepsilon$ that expresses the maximum privacy loss that each data point in
the entire dataset is willing to tolerate. Yet, in practice, different data
points often have different privacy requirements. Having to set one uniform
privacy level is usually too restrictive, often forcing a learner to guarantee
the stringent privacy requirement, at a large cost to accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce our novel Personalized-DP Output Perturbation
method (PDP-OP) that enables to train Ridge regression models with individual
per data point privacy levels. We provide rigorous privacy proofs for our
PDP-OP as well as accuracy guarantees for the resulting model. This work is the
first to provide such theoretical accuracy guarantees when it comes to
personalized DP in machine learning, whereas previous work only provided
empirical evaluations. We empirically evaluate PDP-OP on synthetic and real
datasets and with diverse privacy distributions. We show that by enabling each
data point to specify their own privacy requirement, we can significantly
improve the privacy-accuracy trade-offs in DP. We also show that PDP-OP
outperforms the personalized privacy techniques of Jorgensen et al. (2015).</p>

these models are also vulnerable to security and privacy attacks, such as
jailbreaking attacks, data poisoning attacks, and Personally Identifiable

the security and privacy challenges of LLMs for both training data and users,
along with the application-based risks in various domains, such as
transportation, education, and healthcare. We assess the extent of LLM

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning enhanced by differential privacy has emerged as a popular
approach to better safeguard the privacy of client-side data by protecting
clients' contributions during the training process. Existing solutions
typically assume a uniform privacy budget for all records and provide
one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be adequate to meet each record's
privacy requirement. In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of
cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a
novel framework named rPDP-FL, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme
with both client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to
accommodate varying privacy requirements. A critical and non-trivial problem is
to select the ideal per-record sampling probability q given the personalized
privacy budget {\epsilon}. We introduce a versatile solution named
Simulation-CurveFitting, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the
nonlinear correlation between q and {\epsilon} and derive an elegant
mathematical model to tackle the problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our
solution can provide significant performance gains over the baselines that do

    <p><b>Summary:</b> High-entropy random numbers are an essential part of cryptography, and
Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) are an emergent technology that can
provide high-quality keys for cryptographic algorithms but unfortunately are
currently difficult to access. Existing Entropy-as-a-Service solutions require
users to trust the central authority distributing the key material, which is
not desirable in a high-privacy environment. In this paper, we present a novel
key transmission protocol that allows users to obtain cryptographic material
generated by a QRNG in such a way that the server is unable to identify which
user is receiving each key. This is achieved with the inclusion of Zero
Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), a
cryptographic primitive that allow users to prove knowledge of some value
without needing to reveal it. The security analysis of the protocol proves that
it satisfies the properties of Anonymity, Unforgeability and Confidentiality,
as defined in this document. We also provide an implementation of the protocol
demonstrating its functionality and performance, using NFC as the transmission

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the realm of precision medicine, effective patient stratification and
disease subtyping demand innovative methodologies tailored for multi-omics
data. Clustering techniques applied to multi-omics data have become
instrumental in identifying distinct subgroups of patients, enabling a
finer-grained understanding of disease variability. This work establishes a
powerful framework for advancing precision medicine through unsupervised
random-forest-based clustering and federated computing. We introduce a novel
multi-omics clustering approach utilizing unsupervised random-forests. The
unsupervised nature of the random forest enables the determination of
cluster-specific feature importance, unraveling key molecular contributors to
distinct patient groups. Moreover, our methodology is designed for federated
execution, a crucial aspect in the medical domain where privacy concerns are
paramount. We have validated our approach on machine learning benchmark data
sets as well as on cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our method
is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of disease subtyping, but at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this work, we propose the first framework for integrating Differential
Privacy (DP) and Contextual Integrity (CI). DP is a property of an algorithm
that injects statistical noise to obscure information about individuals
represented within a database. CI defines privacy as information flow that is
appropriate to social context. Analyzed together, these paradigms outline two
dimensions on which to analyze privacy of information flows: descriptive and
normative properties. We show that our new integrated framework provides
benefits to both CI and DP that cannot be attained when each definition is
considered in isolation: it enables contextually-guided tuning of the epsilon
parameter in DP, and it enables CI to be applied to a broader set of
information flows occurring in real-world systems, such as those involving PETs
and machine learning. We conclude with a case study based on the use of DP in

    <p><b>Summary:</b> It has been demonstrated that leading cruise control (LCC) can improve the
operation of mixed-autonomy platoons by allowing connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs) to make longitudinal control decisions based on the information
provided by surrounding vehicles. However, LCC generally requires surrounding
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) to share their real-time states, which can be used
by adversaries to infer drivers' car-following behavior, potentially leading to
financial losses or safety concerns. This paper aims to address such privacy
concerns and protect the behavioral characteristics of HDVs by devising a
parameter privacy-preserving approach for mixed-autonomy platoon control.
First, we integrate a parameter privacy filter into LCC to protect sensitive
car-following parameters. The privacy filter allows each vehicle to generate
seemingly realistic pseudo states by distorting the true parameters to pseudo
parameters, which can protect drivers' privacy in behavioral parameters without
significantly influencing the control performance. Second, to enhance the
practicality and reliability of the privacy filter within LCC, we first extend
the current approach to accommodate continuous parameter spaces through a
neural network estimator. Subsequently, we introduce an individual-level
parameter privacy preservation constraint, focusing on the privacy level of
each individual parameter pair, further enhancing the approach's reliability.
Third, analysis of head-to-tail string stability reveals the potential impact
of privacy filters in degrading mixed traffic flow performance. Simulation
shows that this approach can effectively trade off privacy and control
performance in LCC. We further demonstrate the benefit of such an approach in
networked systems, i.e., by applying the privacy filter to a proceeding
vehicle, one can also achieve a certain level of privacy for the following
vehicle.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) is a class of mathematical standards for assessing
the privacy provided by a data-release mechanism. This work concerns two
important flavors of DP that are related yet conceptually distinct: pure
$\epsilon$-differential privacy ($\epsilon$-DP) and Pufferfish privacy. We
restate $\epsilon$-DP and Pufferfish privacy as Lipschitz continuity conditions
and provide their formulations in terms of an object from the imprecise
probability literature: the interval of measures. We use these formulations to
derive limits on key quantities in frequentist hypothesis testing and in
Bayesian inference using data that are sanitised according to either of these
two privacy standards. Under very mild conditions, the results in this work are
valid for arbitrary parameters, priors and data generating models. These bounds
are weaker than those attainable when analysing specific data generating models
or data-release mechanisms. However, they provide generally applicable limits
on the ability to learn from differentially private data - even when the
analyst's knowledge of the model or mechanism is limited. They also shed light
on the semantic interpretations of the two DP flavors under examination, a
subject of contention in the current literature.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Cross-domain sequential recommendation is an important development direction
of recommender systems. It combines the characteristics of sequential
recommender systems and cross-domain recommender systems, which can capture the
dynamic preferences of users and alleviate the problem of cold-start users.
However, in recent years, people pay more and more attention to their privacy.
They do not want other people to know what they just bought, what videos they
just watched, and where they just came from. How to protect the users' privacy
has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a novel
privacy-preserving cross-domain sequential recommender system (PriCDSR), which
can provide users with recommendation services while preserving their privacy
at the same time. Specifically, we define a new differential privacy on the
data, taking into account both the ID information and the order information.
Then, we design a random mechanism that satisfies this differential privacy and
provide its theoretical proof. Our PriCDSR is a non-invasive method that can
adopt any cross-domain sequential recommender system as a base model without
any modification to it. To the best of our knowledge, our PriCDSR is the first
work to investigate privacy issues in cross-domain sequential recommender
systems. We conduct experiments on three domains, and the results demonstrate
that our PriCDSR, despite introducing noise, still outperforms recommender
systems that only use data from a single domain.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> It is common practice for researchers to join public WhatsApp chats and
scrape their contents for analysis. However, research shows collecting data
this way contradicts user expectations and preferences, even if the data is
effectively public. To overcome these issues, we outline design considerations
for collecting WhatsApp chat data with improved user privacy by heightening
user control and oversight of data collection and taking care to minimize the
data researchers collect and process off a user's device. We refer to these
design principles as User-Centered Data Sharing (UCDS). To evaluate our UCDS
principles, we implemented a mobile application representing one possible
instance of these improved data collection techniques and evaluated the
viability of using the app to collect WhatsApp chat data. Second, we surveyed
WhatsApp users to gather user perceptions on common existing WhatsApp data
collection methods as well as UCDS methods. Our results show that we were able
to glean similar informative insights into WhatsApp chats using UCDS principles
in our prototype app to common, less privacy-preserving methods. Our survey
showed that methods following the UCDS principles are preferred by users
because they offered users more control over the data collection process.
Future user studies could further expand upon UCDS principles to overcome
complications of researcher-to-group communication in research on WhatsApp
chats and evaluate these principles in other data sharing contexts.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Modern manufacturing value chains require intelligent orchestration of
processes across company borders in order to maximize profits while fostering
social and environmental sustainability. However, the implementation of
integrated, systems-level approaches for data-informed decision-making along
value chains is currently hampered by privacy concerns associated with
cross-organizational data exchange and integration. We here propose
Privacy-Preserving Partial Least Squares (P3LS) regression, a novel federated
learning technique that enables cross-organizational data integration and
process modeling with privacy guarantees. P3LS involves a singular value
decomposition (SVD) based PLS algorithm and employs removable, random masks
generated by a trusted authority in order to protect the privacy of the data
contributed by each data holder. We demonstrate the capability of P3LS to
vertically integrate process data along a hypothetical value chain consisting
of three parties and to improve the prediction performance on several
process-related key performance indicators. Furthermore, we show the numerical
equivalence of P3LS and PLS model components on simulated data and provide a
thorough privacy analysis of the former. Moreover, we propose a mechanism for
determining the relevance of the contributed data to the problem being
addressed, thus creating a basis for quantifying the contribution of

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as one of data science's most
transformative and influential domains. However, the widespread adoption of ML
introduces privacy-related concerns owing to the increasing number of malicious
attacks targeting ML models. To address these concerns, Privacy-Preserving
Machine Learning (PPML) methods have been introduced to safeguard the privacy
and security of ML models. One such approach is the use of Homomorphic
Encryption (HE). However, the significant drawbacks and inefficiencies of
traditional HE render it impractical for highly scalable scenarios.
Fortunately, a modern cryptographic scheme, Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption
(HHE), has recently emerged, combining the strengths of symmetric cryptography
and HE to surmount these challenges. Our work seeks to introduce HHE to ML by
designing a PPML scheme tailored for end devices. We leverage HHE as the
fundamental building block to enable secure learning of classification outcomes
over encrypted data, all while preserving the privacy of the input data and ML
model. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our construction by
developing and evaluating an HHE-based PPML application for classifying heart
disease based on sensitive ECG data. Notably, our evaluations revealed a slight
reduction in accuracy compared to inference on plaintext data. Additionally,
both the analyst and end devices experience minimal communication and
computation costs, underscoring the practical viability of our approach. The
successful integration of HHE into PPML provides a glimpse into a more secure
and privacy-conscious future for machine learning on relatively constrained end
devices.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning has been rapidly evolving and gaining popularity in recent
years due to its privacy-preserving features, among other advantages.
Nevertheless, the exchange of model updates and gradients in this architecture
provides new attack surfaces for malicious users of the network which may
jeopardize the model performance and user and data privacy. For this reason,
one of the main motivations for decentralized federated learning is to
eliminate server-related threats by removing the server from the network and
compensating for it through technologies such as blockchain. However, this
advantage comes at the cost of challenging the system with new privacy threats.
Thus, performing a thorough security analysis in this new paradigm is
necessary. This survey studies possible variations of threats and adversaries
in decentralized federated learning and overviews the potential defense
mechanisms. Trustability and verifiability of decentralized federated learning
are also considered in this study.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Future autonomous vehicles (AVs) will use a variety of sensors that generate
a vast amount of data. Naturally, this data not only serves self-driving
algorithms; but can also assist other vehicles or the infrastructure in
real-time decision-making. Consequently, vehicles shall exchange their
measurement data over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies. Moreover,
predicting the state of the road network might be beneficial too. With such a
prediction, we might mitigate road congestion, balance parking lot usage, or
optimize the traffic flow. That would decrease transportation costs as well as
reduce its environmental impact.
  In this paper, we propose a federated measurement and learning system that
provides real-time data to fellow vehicles over Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
communication while also operating a federated learning (FL) scheme over the
Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) link to create a predictive model of the
transportation network. As we are yet to have real-world AV data, we model it
with a non-IID (independent and identically distributed) dataset to evaluate
the capabilities of the proposed system in terms of performance and privacy.
Results indicate that the proposed FL scheme improves learning performance and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Face recognition technology has been deployed in various real-life
applications. The most sophisticated deep learning-based face recognition
systems rely on training millions of face images through complex deep neural
networks to achieve high accuracy. It is quite common for clients to upload
face images to the service provider in order to access the model inference.
However, the face image is a type of sensitive biometric attribute tied to the
identity information of each user. Directly exposing the raw face image to the
service provider poses a threat to the user's privacy. Current
privacy-preserving approaches to face recognition focus on either concealing
visual information on model input or protecting model output face embedding.
The noticeable drop in recognition accuracy is a pitfall for most methods. This
paper proposes a hybrid frequency-color fusion approach to reduce the input
dimensionality of face recognition in the frequency domain. Moreover, sparse
color information is also introduced to alleviate significant accuracy
degradation after adding differential privacy noise. Besides, an
identity-specific embedding mapping scheme is applied to protect original face
embedding by enlarging the distance among identities. Lastly, secure multiparty
computation is implemented for safely computing the embedding distance during
model inference. The proposed method performs well on multiple widely used
verification datasets. Moreover, it has around 2.6% to 4.2% higher accuracy
than the state-of-the-art in the 1:N verification scenario.</p>

medical data often comprises sensitive personal information and is
resource-intensive to acquire for research purposes. In response to this

the generation of synthetic sequence data through Generative Adversarial

the integrity of our synthetic data, we employ a range of quality assessments
and monitor the plausibility between synthetic and original data. To test the
usefulness, we create private machine learning models on a commonly used,

existing data foundation with our synthetic data. Through our GAN-based

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) has achieved remarkable results in the field of
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, existing DP frameworks do not
satisfy all the conditions for becoming metrics, which prevents them from
deriving better basic private properties and leads to exaggerated values on
privacy budgets. We propose Wasserstein differential privacy (WDP), an
alternative DP framework to measure the risk of privacy leakage, which
satisfies the properties of symmetry and triangle inequality. We show and prove
that WDP has 13 excellent properties, which can be theoretical supports for the
better performance of WDP than other DP frameworks. In addition, we derive a
general privacy accounting method called Wasserstein accountant, which enables
WDP to be applied in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) scenarios containing
sub-sampling. Experiments on basic mechanisms, compositions and deep learning
show that the privacy budgets obtained by Wasserstein accountant are relatively
stable and less influenced by order. Moreover, the overestimation on privacy
budgets can be effectively alleviated. The code is available at

optimal transport plan, we show that $(\epsilon, \delta)$-pufferfish privacy is
attained if the additive Laplace noise is calibrated to the differences in mean

secret pair. A typical application is the private release of the summation (or
average) query, for which sufficient conditions are derived for approximating
$\epsilon$-statistical indistinguishability in individual's sensitive data. The
result is then extended to arbitrary prior beliefs trained by Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs): calibrating Laplace noise to a convex combination of differences

$(\epsilon,\delta)$-pufferfish privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Speech is a common input method for mobile embedded devices, but cloud-based
speech recognition systems pose privacy risks. Disentanglement-based encoders,
designed to safeguard user privacy by filtering sensitive information from
speech signals, unfortunately require substantial memory and computational
resources, which limits their use in less powerful devices. To overcome this,
we introduce a novel system, XXX, optimized for such devices. XXX is built on
the insight that speech understanding primarily relies on understanding the
entire utterance's long-term dependencies, while privacy concerns are often
linked to short-term details. Therefore, XXX focuses on selectively masking
these short-term elements, preserving the quality of long-term speech
understanding. The core of XXX is an innovative differential mask generator,
grounded in interpretable learning, which fine-tunes the masking process. We
tested XXX on the STM32H7 microcontroller, assessing its performance in various
potential attack scenarios. The results show that XXX maintains speech
understanding accuracy and privacy at levels comparable to existing encoders,
but with a significant improvement in efficiency, achieving up to 53.3$\times$
faster processing and a 134.1$\times$ smaller memory footprint.</p>

in distinguishing between generated and real speech for human listeners,
resulting in an urgent demand in protecting speakers' voices from malicious

adversarial attacks. The proposed method perturbs speech signals by minimally
altering the original speech while rendering downstream speech generation
models unable to accurately generate the voice of the target speaker. For
validation, we employ the open-source pre-trained YourTTS model for speech
generation and protect the target speaker's speech in the white-box scenario.
Automatic speaker verification (ASV) evaluations were carried out on the
generated speech as the assessment of the voice protection capability. Our
experimental results show that we successfully perturbed the speaker encoder of
the YourTTS model using the gradient-based I-FGSM adversarial perturbation
method. Furthermore, the adversarial perturbation is effective in preventing
the YourTTS model from generating the speech of the target speaker. Audio

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper proposes a privacy-preserving data fusion method for traffic state

accessible by a single trusted party, we explicitly address data privacy
concerns that arise in the collaboration and data sharing between multiple data
owners, such as municipal authorities (MAs) and mobility providers (MPs). To
this end, we propose a novel vertical federated learning (FL) approach, FedTSE,
that enables multiple data owners to collaboratively train and apply a TSE
model without having to exchange their private data. To enhance the
applicability of the proposed FedTSE in common TSE scenarios with limited
availability of ground-truth data, we further propose a privacy-preserving
physics-informed FL approach, i.e., FedTSE-PI, that integrates traffic models
into FL. Real-world data validation shows that the proposed methods can protect
privacy while yielding similar accuracy to the oracle method without privacy
considerations.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry point
to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as
mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user
onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based
applications.
  We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued
by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g. Google,
Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a
signature scheme allowing the signer to \textit{sign using their existing
OpenID accounts} and nothing else. This improves the user experience
significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their
existing accounts.
  zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. By design, zkLogin
builds on top of the underlying platform's authentication mechanisms, and
derives its security from there. Unlike prior related works however, zkLogin
avoids the use of additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or
oracles) for its security guarantees. zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKP) to ensure that the link between a user's off-chain and on-chain
identities is hidden, even from the platform itself.
  We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an
alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. Due to the ease
of web3 on-boarding just with social login, without requiring mnemonics, many
hundreds of thousands zkLogin accounts have already been generated in various
industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT collections, ride
sharing, sports racing and many more.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a
network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model
parameters. In this work, we formalize Differentially Private Hierarchical
Federated Learning (DP-HFL), a DP-enhanced FL methodology that seeks to improve
the privacy-utility tradeoff inherent in FL. Building upon recent proposals for
Hierarchical Differential Privacy (HDP), one of the key concepts of DP-HFL is
adapting DP noise injection at different layers of an established FL hierarchy
-- edge devices, edge servers, and cloud servers -- according to the trust
models within particular subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of
the convergence behavior of DP-HFL, revealing conditions on parameter tuning
under which the model training process converges sublinearly to a stationarity
gap, with this gap depending on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target
privacy level. Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that DP-HFL obtains
substantial improvements in convergence speed over baselines for different
privacy budgets, and validate the impact of network configuration on training.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Trust and privacy have emerged as significant concerns in online
transactions. Sharing information on health is especially sensitive but it is
necessary for purchasing and utilizing health insurance. Evidence shows that
consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology in place of humans, but
the expanding use of AI potentially changes this. This research explores
whether trust and privacy concern are barriers to the adoption of AI in health
insurance. Two scenarios are compared: The first scenario has limited AI that
is not in the interface and its presence is not explicitly revealed to the
consumer. In the second scenario there is an AI interface and AI evaluation,
and this is explicitly revealed to the consumer. The two scenarios were modeled
and compared using SEM PLS-MGA. The findings show that trust is significantly
lower in the second scenario where AI is visible. Privacy concerns are higher
with AI but the difference is not statistically significant within the model.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Location-based services (LBSs) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) offer
users numerous conveniences. However, the extensive use of LBSs raises concerns
about the privacy of users' trajectories, as adversaries can exploit temporal
correlations between different locations to extract personal information.
Additionally, users have varying privacy requirements depending on the time and
location. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized
trajectory privacy protection mechanism (PTPPM). This mechanism first uses the
temporal correlation between trajectory locations to determine the possible
location set for each time instant. We identify a protection location set (PLS)
for each location by employing the Hilbert curve-based minimum distance search
algorithm. This approach incorporates the complementary features of
geo-indistinguishability and distortion privacy. We put forth a novel
Permute-and-Flip mechanism for location perturbation, which maps its initial
application in data publishing privacy protection to a location perturbation
mechanism. This mechanism generates fake locations with smaller perturbation
distances while improving the balance between privacy and quality of service
(QoS). Simulation results show that our mechanism outperforms the benchmark by
providing enhanced privacy protection while meeting user's QoS requirements.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for preserving
data privacy in recommendation systems by training models locally. Recently,
Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained popularity in recommendation tasks due
to their ability to capture high-order interactions between users and items.
However, privacy concerns prevent the global sharing of the entire user-item
graph. To address this limitation, some methods create pseudo-interacted items
or users in the graph to compensate for missing information for each client.
Unfortunately, these methods introduce random noise and raise privacy concerns.
In this paper, we propose FedRKG, a novel federated recommendation system,
where a global knowledge graph (KG) is constructed and maintained on the server
using publicly available item information, enabling higher-order user-item
interactions. On the client side, a relation-aware GNN model leverages diverse
KG relationships. To protect local interaction items and obscure gradients, we
employ pseudo-labeling and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Extensive
experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive
performance of our approach compared to centralized algorithms while ensuring
privacy preservation. Moreover, FedRKG achieves an average accuracy improvement
of 4% compared to existing federated learning baselines.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is a data-minimization approach enabling
collaborative model training across diverse clients with local data, avoiding
direct data exchange. However, state-of-the-art FL solutions to identify
fraudulent financial transactions exhibit a subset of the following
limitations. They (1) lack a formal security definition and proof, (2) assume
prior freezing of suspicious customers' accounts by financial institutions
(limiting the solutions' adoption), (3) scale poorly, involving either $O(n^2)$
computationally expensive modular exponentiation (where $n$ is the total number
of financial institutions) or highly inefficient fully homomorphic encryption,
(4) assume the parties have already completed the identity alignment phase,
hence excluding it from the implementation, performance evaluation, and
security analysis, and (5) struggle to resist clients' dropouts. This work
introduces Starlit, a novel scalable privacy-preserving FL mechanism that
overcomes these limitations. It has various applications, such as enhancing
financial fraud detection, mitigating terrorism, and enhancing digital health.
We implemented Starlit and conducted a thorough performance analysis using
synthetic data from a key player in global financial transactions. The

However, the exchange of sensitive patient data, such as chest X-rays, poses

achieves comparable accuracy to models trained on non-encrypted images,
offering a secure solution for outsourcing ML computations while preserving

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Addressing trust concerns in Smart Home (SH) systems is imperative due to the
limited study on preservation approaches that focus on analyzing and evaluating
privacy threats for effective risk management. While most research focuses
primarily on user privacy, device data privacy, especially identity privacy, is
almost neglected, which can significantly impact overall user privacy within
the SH system. To this end, our study incorporates privacy engineering (PE)
principles in the SH system that consider user and device data privacy. We
start with a comprehensive reference model for a typical SH system. Based on
the initial stage of LINDDUN PRO for the PE framework, we present a data flow
diagram (DFD) based on a typical SH reference model to better understand SH
system operations. To identify potential areas of privacy threat and perform a
privacy threat analysis (PTA), we employ the LINDDUN PRO threat model. Then, a
privacy impact assessment (PIA) was carried out to implement privacy risk
management by prioritizing privacy threats based on their likelihood of
occurrence and potential consequences. Finally, we suggest possible privacy
enhancement techniques (PETs) that can mitigate some of these threats. The
study aims to elucidate the main threats to privacy, associated risks, and
effective prioritization of privacy control in SH systems. The outcomes of this
study are expected to benefit SH stakeholders, including vendors, cloud

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Yingen Zhu, Jia Huang, Hongzhou Lu, Wenjin Wang</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> The monitoring of vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate
(RR) during sleep is important for the assessment of sleep quality and
detection of sleep disorders. Camera-based HR and RR monitoring gained
popularity in sleep monitoring in recent years. However, they are all facing
with serious privacy issues when using a video camera in the sleeping scenario.
In this paper, we propose to use the defocused camera to measure vital signs
from optically blurred images, which can fundamentally eliminate the privacy
invasion as face is difficult to be identified in obtained blurry images. A
spatial-redundant framework involving living-skin detection is used to extract
HR and RR from the defocused camera in NIR, and a motion metric is designed to
exclude outliers caused by body motions. In the benchmark, the overall Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) for HR measurement is 4.4 bpm, for RR measurement is 5.9
bpm. Both have quality drops as compared to the measurement using a focused
camera, but the degradation in HR is much less, i.e. HR measurement has strong
correlation with the reference ($R \geq 0.90$). Preliminary experiments suggest
that it is feasible to use a defocused camera for cardio-respiratory monitoring
while protecting the privacy. Further improvement is needed for robust RR
measurement, such as by PPG-modulation based RR extraction.</p>

data. A multitude of participants and a server cooperatively train a model
without the need for data disclosure or collection. The healthcare industry,
where security and privacy are paramount, can substantially benefit from this
new learning paradigm, as data collection is no longer feasible due to
stringent data policies. Nonetheless, unaddressed challenges and insufficient
attack mitigation are hampering its adoption. Attack surfaces differ from
traditional centralized learning in that the server and clients communicate
between each round of training. In this paper, we thus present vulnerabilities,

promising new research directions toward a more robust FL.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning is a promising approach for learning from user data while
preserving data privacy. However, the high requirements of the model training
process make it difficult for clients with limited memory or bandwidth to
participate. To tackle this problem, Split Federated Learning is utilized,
where clients upload their intermediate model training outcomes to a cloud
server for collaborative server-client model training. This methodology
facilitates resource-constrained clients' participation in model training but
also increases the training time and communication overhead. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, called Hierarchical Split Federated
Learning (HierSFL), that amalgamates models at the edge and cloud phases,
presenting qualitative directives for determining the best aggregation
timeframes to reduce computation and communication expenses. By implementing
local differential privacy at the client and edge server levels, we enhance
privacy during local model parameter updates. Our experiments using CIFAR-10
and MNIST datasets show that HierSFL outperforms standard FL approaches with
better training accuracy, training time, and communication-computing
trade-offs. HierSFL offers a promising solution to mobile edge computing's
challenges, ultimately leading to faster content delivery and improved mobile

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Adaptive experiment is widely adopted to estimate conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) in clinical trials and many other scenarios. While the
primary goal in experiment is to maximize estimation accuracy, due to the
imperative of social welfare, it's also crucial to provide treatment with
superior outcomes to patients, which is measured by regret in contextual bandit
framework. These two objectives often lead to contrast optimal allocation
mechanism. Furthermore, privacy concerns arise in clinical scenarios containing
sensitive data like patients health records. Therefore, it's essential for the
treatment allocation mechanism to incorporate robust privacy protection
measures. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between loss of social
welfare and statistical power in contextual bandit experiment. We propose a
matched upper and lower bound for the multi-objective optimization problem, and
then adopt the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the
optimality condition. Furthermore, we propose differentially private algorithms
which still matches the lower bound, showing that privacy is "almost free".
Additionally, we derive the asymptotic normality of the estimator, which is
essential in statistical inference and hypothesis testing.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study the per-datum Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), where an attacker
aims to infer whether a fixed target datum has been included in the input
dataset of an algorithm and thus, violates privacy. First, we define the
membership leakage of a datum as the advantage of the optimal adversary
targeting to identify it. Then, we quantify the per-datum membership leakage
for the empirical mean, and show that it depends on the Mahalanobis distance
between the target datum and the data-generating distribution. We further
assess the effect of two privacy defences, i.e. adding Gaussian noise and
sub-sampling. We quantify exactly how both of them decrease the per-datum
membership leakage. Our analysis builds on a novel proof technique that
combines an Edgeworth expansion of the likelihood ratio test and a
Lindeberg-Feller central limit theorem. Our analysis connects the existing
likelihood ratio and scalar product attacks, and also justifies different
canary selection strategies used in the privacy auditing literature. Finally,
our experiments demonstrate the impacts of the leakage score, the sub-sampling
ratio and the noise scale on the per-datum membership leakage as indicated by
the theory.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Decentralized Gradient Descent (D-GD) allows a set of users to perform
collaborative learning without sharing their data by iteratively averaging
local model updates with their neighbors in a network graph. The absence of
direct communication between non-neighbor nodes might lead to the belief that
users cannot infer precise information about the data of others. In this work,
we demonstrate the opposite, by proposing the first attack against D-GD that
enables a user (or set of users) to reconstruct the private data of other users
outside their immediate neighborhood. Our approach is based on a reconstruction
attack against the gossip averaging protocol, which we then extend to handle
the additional challenges raised by D-GD. We validate the effectiveness of our
attack on real graphs and datasets, showing that the number of users
compromised by a single or a handful of attackers is often surprisingly large.
We empirically investigate some of the factors that affect the performance of
the attack, namely the graph topology, the number of attackers, and their
position in the graph.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This study presents a unique framework that applies and extends Solove
(2006)'s taxonomy to address privacy concerns in interactions with text-based
AI chatbots. As chatbot prevalence grows, concerns about user privacy have
heightened. While existing literature highlights design elements compromising
privacy, a comprehensive framework is lacking. Through semi-structured
interviews with 13 participants interacting with two AI chatbots, this study
identifies 9 privacy harms and 9 privacy risks in text-based interactions.
Using a grounded theory approach for interview and chatlog analysis, the
framework examines privacy implications at various interaction stages. The aim
is to offer developers, policymakers, and researchers a tool for responsible
and secure implementation of conversational AI, filling the existing gap in
addressing privacy issues associated with text-based AI chatbots.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prevalent distributed machine
learning scheme that enables collaborative model training without aggregating
raw data. Cloud service providers further embrace Federated Learning as a
Service (FLaaS), allowing data analysts to execute their FL training pipelines
over differentially-protected data. Due to the intrinsic properties of
differential privacy, the enforced privacy level on data blocks can be viewed
as a privacy budget that requires careful scheduling to cater to diverse
training pipelines. Existing privacy budget scheduling studies prioritize
either efficiency or fairness individually. In this paper, we propose
DPBalance, a novel privacy budget scheduling mechanism that jointly optimizes
both efficiency and fairness. We first develop a comprehensive utility function
incorporating data analyst-level dominant shares and FL-specific performance
metrics. A sequential allocation mechanism is then designed using the Lagrange
multiplier method and effective greedy heuristics. We theoretically prove that
DPBalance satisfies Pareto Efficiency, Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, and
Weak Strategy Proofness. We also theoretically prove the existence of a
fairness-efficiency tradeoff in privacy budgeting. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DPBalance outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving an
average efficiency improvement of $1.44\times \sim 3.49 \times$, and an average
fairness improvement of $1.37\times \sim 24.32 \times$.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep learning offers a promising solution to improve spectrum access
techniques by utilizing data-driven approaches to manage and share limited
spectrum resources for emerging applications. For several of these
applications, the sensitive wireless data (such as spectrograms) are stored in
a shared database or multistakeholder cloud environment and are therefore prone
to privacy leaks. This paper aims to address such privacy concerns by examining
the representative case study of shared database scenarios in 5G Open Radio
Access Network (O-RAN) networks where we have a shared database within the
near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller. We focus on securing the
data that can be used by machine learning (ML) models for spectrum sharing and
interference mitigation applications without compromising the model and network
performances. The underlying idea is to leverage a (i) Shuffling-based
learnable encryption technique to encrypt the data, following which, (ii)
employ a custom Vision transformer (ViT) as the trained ML model that is
capable of performing accurate inferences on such encrypted data. The paper
offers a thorough analysis and comparisons with analogous convolutional neural
networks (CNN) as well as deeper architectures (such as ResNet-50) as
baselines. Our experiments showcase that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms the baseline CNN with an improvement of 24.5% and 23.9% for the
percent accuracy and F1-Score respectively when operated on encrypted data.
Though deeper ResNet-50 architecture is obtained as a slightly more accurate
model, with an increase of 4.4%, the proposed approach boasts a reduction of
parameters by 99.32%, and thus, offers a much-improved prediction time by
nearly 60%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation in the Internet of Vehicles
(IoV) continues to be a focal point of interest in both the industry and
academia. Aiming at tackling the challenges and solving the remaining
limitations of existing works, this paper introduces a novel Schnorr
approval-based IoV data aggregation framework based on a two-layered
architecture. In this framework, a server can aggregate the IoV data from
clusters without inferring the raw data, real identity and trajectories of
vehicles. Notably, we avoid incorporating the widely-accepted techniques such
as homomorphic encryption and digital pseudonym to avoid introducing high
computation cost to vehicles. We propose a novel concept, data approval, based
on the Schnorr signature scheme. With the approval, the fake data injection
attack carried out by a cluster head can be defended against. The separation of
liability is achieved as well. The evaluation shows that the framework is
secure and lightweight for vehicles in terms of the computation and
communication costs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A major impediment to the advancement of sign language translation (SLT) is
data scarcity. Much of the sign language data currently available on the web
cannot be used for training supervised models due to the lack of aligned
captions. Furthermore, scaling SLT using large-scale web-scraped datasets bears
privacy risks due to the presence of biometric information, which the
responsible development of SLT technologies should account for. In this work,
we propose a two-stage framework for privacy-aware SLT at scale that addresses
both of these issues. We introduce SSVP-SLT, which leverages self-supervised
video pretraining on anonymized and unannotated videos, followed by supervised
SLT finetuning on a curated parallel dataset. SSVP-SLT achieves
state-of-the-art finetuned and zero-shot gloss-free SLT performance on the
How2Sign dataset, outperforming the strongest respective baselines by over 3
BLEU-4. Based on controlled experiments, we further discuss the advantages and
limitations of self-supervised pretraining and anonymization via facial
obfuscation for SLT.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> For small privacy parameter $\epsilon$, $\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP)
provides a strong worst-case guarantee that no membership inference attack
(MIA) can succeed at determining whether a person's data was used to train a
machine learning model. The guarantee of DP is worst-case because: a) it holds
even if the attacker already knows the records of all but one person in the
data set; and b) it holds uniformly over all data sets. In practical
applications, such a worst-case guarantee may be overkill: practical attackers
may lack exact knowledge of (nearly all of) the private data, and our data set
might be easier to defend, in some sense, than the worst-case data set. Such
considerations have motivated the industrial deployment of DP models with large
privacy parameter (e.g. $\epsilon \geq 7$), and it has been observed
empirically that DP with large $\epsilon$ can successfully defend against
state-of-the-art MIAs. Existing DP theory cannot explain these empirical
findings: e.g., the theoretical privacy guarantees of $\epsilon \geq 7$ are
essentially vacuous. In this paper, we aim to close this gap between theory and
practice and understand why a large DP parameter can prevent practical MIAs. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new privacy notion called practical
membership privacy (PMP). PMP models a practical attacker's uncertainty about
the contents of the private data. The PMP parameter has a natural
interpretation in terms of the success rate of a practical MIA on a given data
set. We quantitatively analyze the PMP parameter of two fundamental DP
mechanisms: the exponential mechanism and Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis
reveals that a large DP parameter often translates into a much smaller PMP
parameter, which guarantees strong privacy against practical MIAs. Using our
findings, we offer principled guidance for practitioners in choosing the DP
parameter.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep neural networks are extensively applied to real-world tasks, such as
face recognition and medical image classification, where privacy and data
protection are critical. Image data, if not protected, can be exploited to
infer personal or contextual information. Existing privacy preservation
methods, like encryption, generate perturbed images that are unrecognizable to
even humans. Adversarial attack approaches prohibit automated inference even
for authorized stakeholders, limiting practical incentives for commercial and
widespread adaptation. This pioneering study tackles an unexplored practical
privacy preservation use case by generating human-perceivable images that
maintain accurate inference by an authorized model while evading other
unauthorized black-box models of similar or dissimilar objectives, and
addresses the previous research gaps. The datasets employed are ImageNet, for
image classification, Celeba-HQ dataset, for identity classification, and
AffectNet, for emotion classification. Our results show that the generated
images can successfully maintain the accuracy of a protected model and degrade
the average accuracy of the unauthorized black-box models to 11.97%, 6.63%, and
55.51% on ImageNet, Celeba-HQ, and AffectNet datasets, respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The current routing protocol used in the internet backbone is based on manual
configuration, making it susceptible to errors. To mitigate these
configuration-related issues, it becomes imperative to validate the accuracy
and convergence of the algorithm, ensuring a seamless operation devoid of
problems. However, the process of network verification faces challenges related
to privacy and scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by
introducing a novel approach: leveraging privacy-preserving computation,
specifically multiparty computation (MPC), to verify the correctness of
configurations in the internet backbone, governed by the BGP protocol. Not only
does our proposed solution effectively address scalability concerns, but it
also establishes a robust privacy framework. Through rigorous analysis, we
demonstrate that our approach maintains privacy by not disclosing any
information beyond the query result, thus providing a comprehensive and secure
solution to the intricacies associated with routing protocol verification in
large-scale networks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study a two-sided online data ecosystem comprised of an online platform,
users on the platform, and downstream learners or data buyers. The learners can
buy user data on the platform (to run a statistic or machine learning task).
Potential users decide whether to join by looking at the trade-off between i)
their benefit from joining the platform and interacting with other users and
ii) the privacy costs they incur from sharing their data.
  First, we introduce a novel modeling element for two-sided data platforms:
the privacy costs of the users are endogenous and depend on how much of their
data is purchased by the downstream learners. Then, we characterize marketplace
equilibria in certain simple settings. In particular, we provide a full
characterization in two variants of our model that correspond to different
utility functions for the users: i) when each user gets a constant benefit for
participating in the platform and ii) when each user's benefit is linearly
increasing in the number of other users that participate. In both variants,
equilibria in our setting are significantly different from equilibria when
privacy costs are exogenous and fixed, highlighting the importance of taking
endogeneity in the privacy costs into account. Finally, we provide simulations
and semi-synthetic experiments to extend our results to more general
assumptions. We experiment with different distributions of users' privacy costs
and different functional forms of the users' utilities for joining the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The recent emergence of ubiquitous, multi-platform eye tracking has raised
user privacy concerns over re-identification across platforms, where a person
is re-identified across multiple eye tracking-enabled platforms using
personally identifying information that is implicitly expressed through their
eye movement. We present an empirical investigation quantifying a modern eye
movement biometric model's ability to link subject identities across three
different eye tracking devices using eye movement signals from each device. We
show that a state-of-the art eye movement biometrics model demonstrates
above-chance levels of biometric performance (34.99% equal error rate, 15%
rank-1 identification rate) when linking user identities across one pair of
devices, but not for the other. Considering these findings, we also discuss the
impact that eye tracking signal quality has on the model's ability to
meaningfully associate a subject's identity between two substantially different
eye tracking devices. Our investigation advances a fundamental understanding of
the privacy risks for identity linkage across platforms by employing both
quantitative and qualitative measures of biometric performance, including a
visualization of the model's ability to distinguish genuine and imposter
authentication attempts across platforms.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Language Models as a Service (LMaaS) offers convenient access for developers
and researchers to perform inference using pre-trained language models.
Nonetheless, the input data and the inference results containing private
information are exposed as plaintext during the service call, leading to
privacy issues. Recent studies have started tackling the privacy issue by
transforming input data into privacy-preserving representation from the
user-end with the techniques such as noise addition and content perturbation,
while the exploration of inference result protection, namely decision privacy,
is still a blank page. In order to maintain the black-box manner of LMaaS,
conducting data privacy protection, especially for the decision, is a
challenging task because the process has to be seamless to the models and
accompanied by limited communication and computation overhead. We thus propose
Instance-Obfuscated Inference (IOI) method, which focuses on addressing the
decision privacy issue of natural language understanding tasks in their
complete life-cycle. Besides, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance as well as the privacy-protection strength of the proposed
method on various benchmarking tasks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We consider a producer's problem of selling a product to a continuum of
privacy-conscious consumers, where the producer can implement third-degree
price discrimination, offering different prices to different market segments.
In the absence of privacy constraints, Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015]
characterize the set of all possible consumer-producer utilities, showing that
it is a triangle. We consider a privacy mechanism that provides a degree of
protection by probabilistically masking each market segment, and we establish
that the resultant set of all consumer-producer utilities forms a convex
polygon, characterized explicitly as a linear mapping of a certain
high-dimensional convex polytope into $\mathbb{R}^2$. This characterization
enables us to investigate the impact of the privacy mechanism on both producer
and consumer utilities. In particular, we establish that the privacy constraint
always hurts the producer by reducing both the maximum and minimum utility
achievable. From the consumer's perspective, although the privacy mechanism
ensures an increase in the minimum utility compared to the non-private
scenario, interestingly, it may reduce the maximum utility. Finally, we
demonstrate that increasing the privacy level does not necessarily intensify
these effects. For instance, the maximum utility for the producer or the
minimum utility for the consumer may exhibit nonmonotonic behavior in response
to an increase of the privacy level.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> How can individuals exchange information to learn from each other despite
their privacy needs and security concerns? For example, consider individuals
deliberating a contentious topic and being concerned about divulging their
private experiences. Preserving individual privacy and enabling efficient
social learning are both important desiderata but seem fundamentally at odds
with each other and very hard to reconcile. We do so by controlling information
leakage using rigorous statistical guarantees that are based on differential
privacy (DP). Our agents use log-linear rules to update their beliefs after
communicating with their neighbors. Adding DP randomization noise to beliefs
provides communicating agents with plausible deniability with regard to their
private information and their network neighborhoods. We consider two learning
environments one for distributed maximum-likelihood estimation given a finite
number of private signals and another for online learning from an infinite,
intermittent signal stream. Noisy information aggregation in the finite case
leads to interesting tradeoffs between rejecting low-quality states and making
sure all high-quality states are accepted in the algorithm output. Our results
flesh out the nature of the trade-offs in both cases between the quality of the
group decision outcomes, learning accuracy, communication cost, and the level
of privacy protections that the agents are afforded.</p>

systems. Prior research has shown that eye tracking data can be used for
re-identification attacks. The state of our knowledge about currently existing
privacy mechanisms is limited to privacy-utility trade-off curves based on
data-centric metrics of utility, such as prediction error, and black-box threat
models. We propose that for interactive VR applications, it is essential to
consider user-centric notions of utility and a variety of threat models. We
develop a methodology to evaluate real-time privacy mechanisms for interactive
VR applications that incorporate subjective user experience and task
performance metrics. We evaluate selected privacy mechanisms using this
methodology and find that re-identification accuracy can be decreased to as low
as 14% while maintaining a high usability score and reasonable task
performance. Finally, we elucidate three threat scenarios (black-box, black-box
with exemplars, and white-box) and assess how well the different privacy
mechanisms hold up to these adversarial scenarios. This work advances the state
of the art in VR privacy by providing a methodology for end-to-end assessment
of the risk of re-identification attacks and potential mitigating solutions.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the increasing amount of data in society, privacy concerns in data
sharing have become widely recognized. Particularly, protecting personal
attribute information is essential for a wide range of aims from crowdsourcing
to realizing personalized medicine. Although various differentially private
methods based on randomized response have been proposed for single attribute
information or specific analysis purposes such as frequency estimation, there
is a lack of studies on the mechanism for sharing individuals' multiple
categorical information itself. The existing randomized response for sharing
multi-attribute data uses the Kronecker product to perturb each attribute
information in turn according to the respective privacy level but achieves only
a weak privacy level for the entire dataset. Therefore, in this study, we
propose a privacy-optimized randomized response that guarantees the strongest
privacy in sharing multi-attribute data. Furthermore, we present an efficient
heuristic algorithm for constructing a near-optimal mechanism. The time
complexity of our algorithm is O(k^2), where k is the number of attributes, and
it can be performed in about 1 second even for large datasets with k = 1,000.
The experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods provide
significantly stronger privacy guarantees for the entire dataset than the
existing method. In addition, we show an analysis example using genome
statistics to confirm that our methods can achieve less than half the output
error compared with that of the existing method. Overall, this study is an
important step toward trustworthy sharing and analysis of multi-attribute data.

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Mini-applications, commonly referred to as mini-apps, are compact software
programs embedded within larger applications or platforms, offering targeted
functionality without the need for separate installations. Typically web-based
or cloud-hosted, these mini-apps streamline user experiences by providing
focused services accessible through web browsers or mobile apps. Their
simplicity, speed, and integration capabilities make them valuable additions to
messaging platforms, social media networks, e-commerce sites, and various
digital environments. WeChat Mini Programs, a prominent feature of China's
leading messaging app, exemplify this trend, offering users a seamless array of
services without additional downloads. Leveraging WeChat's extensive user base
and payment infrastructure, Mini Programs facilitate efficient transactions and
bridge online and offline experiences, shaping China's digital landscape
significantly. This paper investigates the potential of employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect privacy breaches within WeChat Mini Programs.
Given the widespread use of Mini Programs and growing concerns about data
privacy, this research seeks to determine if LLMs can effectively identify
instances of privacy leakage within this ecosystem. Through meticulous analysis
and experimentation, we aim to highlight the efficacy of LLMs in safeguarding
user privacy and security within the WeChat Mini Program environment, thereby
contributing to a more secure digital landscape.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Human activity recognition (HAR) is a well-established field, significantly
advanced by modern machine learning (ML) techniques. While companies have
successfully integrated HAR into consumer products, they typically rely on a
predefined activity set, which limits personalizations at the user level (edge
devices). Despite advancements in Incremental Learning for updating models with
new data, this often occurs on the Cloud, necessitating regular data transfers
between cloud and edge devices, thus leading to data privacy issues. In this
paper, we propose MAGNETO, an Edge AI platform that pushes HAR tasks from the
Cloud to the Edge. MAGNETO allows incremental human activity learning directly
on the Edge devices, without any data exchange with the Cloud. This enables
strong privacy guarantees, low processing latency, and a high degree of
personalization for users. In particular, we demonstrate MAGNETO in an Android
device, validating the whole pipeline from data collection to result
visualization.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> To defend against privacy leakage of user data, differential privacy is
widely used in federated learning, but it is not free. The addition of noise
randomly disrupts the semantic integrity of the model and this disturbance
accumulates with increased communication rounds. In this paper, we introduce a
novel federated learning framework with rigorous privacy guarantees, named
FedCEO, designed to strike a trade-off between model utility and user privacy
by letting clients ''Collaborate with Each Other''. Specifically, we perform
efficient tensor low-rank proximal optimization on stacked local model
parameters at the server, demonstrating its capability to flexibly truncate
high-frequency components in spectral space. This implies that our FedCEO can
effectively recover the disrupted semantic information by smoothing the global
semantic space for different privacy settings and continuous training
processes. Moreover, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off bound by an
order of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We illustrate our
theoretical results with experiments on representative image datasets. It
observes significant performance improvements and strict privacy guarantees
under different privacy settings.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Private selection mechanisms (e.g., Report Noisy Max, Sparse Vector) are
fundamental primitives of differentially private (DP) data analysis with wide
applications to private query release, voting, and hyperparameter tuning.
Recent work (Liu and Talwar, 2019; Papernot and Steinke, 2022) has made
significant progress in both generalizing private selection mechanisms and
tightening their privacy analysis using modern numerical privacy accounting
tools, e.g., R\'enyi DP. But R\'enyi DP is known to be lossy when
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP is ultimately needed, and there is a trend to close the
gap by directly handling privacy profiles, i.e., $\delta$ as a function of
$\epsilon$ or its equivalent dual form known as $f$-DPs. In this paper, we work
out an easy-to-use recipe that bounds the privacy profiles of ReportNoisyMax
and PrivateTuning using the privacy profiles of the base algorithms they
corral. Numerically, our approach improves over the RDP-based accounting in all
regimes of interest and leads to substantial benefits in end-to-end private
learning experiments. Our analysis also suggests new distributions, e.g.,
binomial distribution for randomizing the number of rounds that leads to more
substantial improvements in certain regimes.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold are two classical differentially private
(DP) selection mechanisms. Their output is obtained by adding noise to a
sequence of low-sensitivity queries and reporting the identity of the query
whose (noisy) answer satisfies a certain condition. Pure DP guarantees for
these mechanisms are easy to obtain when Laplace noise is added to the queries.
On the other hand, when instantiated using Gaussian noise, standard analyses
only yield approximate DP guarantees despite the fact that the outputs of these
mechanisms lie in a discrete space. In this work, we revisit the analysis of
Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold with Gaussian noise and show that, under
the additional assumption that the underlying queries are bounded, it is
possible to provide pure ex-ante DP bounds for Report Noisy Max and pure
ex-post DP bounds for Above Threshold. The resulting bounds are tight and
depend on closed-form expressions that can be numerically evaluated using
standard methods. Empirically we find these lead to tighter privacy accounting
in the high privacy, low data regime. Further, we propose a simple privacy
filter for composing pure ex-post DP guarantees, and use it to derive a fully
adaptive Gaussian Sparse Vector Technique mechanism. Finally, we provide
experiments on mobility and energy consumption datasets demonstrating that our
Sparse Vector Technique is practically competitive with previous approaches and
requires less hyper-parameter tuning.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based semantic segmentation of the robotic
instruments and tissues can enhance the precision of surgical activities in
robot-assisted surgery. However, in biological learning, DNNs cannot learn
incremental tasks over time and exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which refers
to the sharp decline in performance on previously learned tasks after learning
a new one. Specifically, when data scarcity is the issue, the model shows a
rapid drop in performance on previously learned instruments after learning new
data with new instruments. The problem becomes worse when it limits releasing
the dataset of the old instruments for the old model due to privacy concerns
and the unavailability of the data for the new or updated version of the
instruments for the continual learning model. For this purpose, we develop a
privacy-preserving synthetic continual semantic segmentation framework by
blending and harmonizing (i) open-source old instruments foreground to the
synthesized background without revealing real patient data in public and (ii)
new instruments foreground to extensively augmented real background. To boost
the balanced logit distillation from the old model to the continual learning
model, we design overlapping class-aware temperature normalization (CAT) by
controlling model learning utility. We also introduce multi-scale
shifted-feature distillation (SD) to maintain long and short-range spatial
relationships among the semantic objects where conventional short-range spatial
features with limited information reduce the power of feature distillation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the EndoVis 2017 and 2018
instrument segmentation dataset with a generalized continual learning setting.

    <p><b>Summary:</b> High-quality, distributed quantum entanglement is the distinctive resource
for quantum communication and forms the foundation for the unequalled level of
security that can be assured in quantum key distribution. While the
entanglement provider does not need to be trusted, the secure key rate drops to
zero if the entanglement used is too noisy. In this paper, we show
experimentally that QPA is able to increase the secure key rate achievable with
QKD by improving the quality of distributed entanglement, thus increasing the
quantum advantage in QKD. Beyond that, we show that QPA enables key generation
at noise levels that previously prevented key generation. These remarkable
results were only made possible by the efficient implementation exploiting
hyperentanglement in the polarisation and energy-time degrees of freedom. We
provide a detailed characterisation of the gain in secure key rate achieved in
our proof-of-principle experiment at different noise levels. The results are
paramount for the implementation of a global quantum network linking quantum
processors and ensuring future-proof data security.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning models are susceptible to membership inference attacks
(MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is in the training set. Existing
work utilizes gradient ascent to enlarge the loss variance of training data,
alleviating the privacy risk. However, optimizing toward a reverse direction
may cause the model parameters to oscillate near local minima, leading to
instability and suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method
-- Convex-Concave Loss, which enables a high variance of training loss
distribution by gradient descent. Our method is motivated by the theoretical
analysis that convex losses tend to decrease the loss variance during training.
Thus, our key idea behind CCL is to reduce the convexity of loss functions with
a concave term. Trained with CCL, neural networks produce losses with high
variance for training data, reinforcing the defense against MIAs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of CCL, achieving state-of-the-art
balance in the privacy-utility trade-off.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this paper we study the problem of estimating the unknown mean $\theta$ of
a unit variance Gaussian distribution in a locally differentially private (LDP)
way. In the high-privacy regime ($\epsilon\le 0.67$), we identify the exact
optimal privacy mechanism that minimizes the variance of the estimator
asymptotically. It turns out to be the extraordinarily simple sign mechanism
that applies randomized response to the sign of $X_i-\theta$. However, since
this optimal mechanism depends on the unknown mean $\theta$, we employ a
two-stage LDP parameter estimation procedure which requires splitting agents
into two groups. The first $n_1$ observations are used to consistently but not
necessarily efficiently estimate the parameter $\theta$ by
$\tilde{\theta}_{n_1}$. Then this estimate is updated by applying the sign
mechanism with $\tilde{\theta}_{n_1}$ instead of $\theta$ to the remaining
$n-n_1$ observations, to obtain an LDP and efficient estimator of the unknown
mean.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Fairness and privacy are two important values machine learning (ML)
practitioners often seek to operationalize in models. Fairness aims to reduce
model bias for social/demographic sub-groups. Privacy via differential privacy
(DP) mechanisms, on the other hand, limits the impact of any individual's
training data on the resulting model. The trade-offs between privacy and
fairness goals of trustworthy ML pose a challenge to those wishing to address
both. We show that DP amplifies gender, racial, and religious bias when
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), producing models more biased than
ones fine-tuned without DP. We find the cause of the amplification to be a
disparity in convergence of gradients across sub-groups. Through the case of
binary gender bias, we demonstrate that Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA),
a known method for addressing bias, also mitigates bias amplification by DP. As
a consequence, DP and CDA together can be used to fine-tune models while
maintaining both fairness and privacy.</p>

potential privacy vulnerabilities in these representations. This paper
investigates the structural vulnerabilities in graph neural models where
sensitive topological information can be inferred through edge reconstruction
attacks. Our research primarily addresses the theoretical underpinnings of
cosine-similarity-based edge reconstruction attacks (COSERA), providing
theoretical and empirical evidence that such attacks can perfectly reconstruct
sparse Erdos Renyi graphs with independent random features as graph size
increases. Conversely, we establish that sparsity is a critical factor for
COSERA's effectiveness, as demonstrated through analysis and experiments on
stochastic block models. Finally, we explore the resilience of (provably)
private graph representations produced via noisy aggregation (NAG) mechanism
against COSERA. We empirically delineate instances wherein COSERA demonstrates
both efficacy and deficiency in its capacity to function as an instrument for
elucidating the trade-off between privacy and utility.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence
(AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR)
devices and setups being more pervasive. While these devices and setups provide
users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different
sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters
are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques. In this
paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them
in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences
through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs
for particular purposes. We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity
for XR use. In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational
capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might
help XR be more used in everyday life. Lastly, we speculate that combining the
information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric
data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions. While
studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences
should also be investigated. In summary, despite some challenges, embedding
LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In Vehicle-to-Everything networks that involve multi-hop communication, the
Road Side Units (RSUs) typically aim to collect location information from the
participating vehicles to provide security and network diagnostics features.
While the vehicles commonly use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for
navigation, they may refrain from sharing their precise GPS coordinates with
the RSUs due to privacy concerns. Therefore, to jointly address the high
localization requirements by the RSUs as well as the vehicles' privacy, we
present a novel spatial-provenance framework wherein each vehicle uses Bloom
filters to embed their partial location information when forwarding the
packets. In this framework, the RSUs and the vehicles agree upon fragmenting
the coverage area into several smaller regions so that the vehicles can embed
the identity of their regions through Bloom filters. Given the probabilistic
nature of Bloom filters, we derive an analytical expression on the error-rates
in provenance recovery and then pose an optimization problem to choose the
underlying parameters. With the help of extensive simulation results, we show
that our method offers near-optimal Bloom filter parameters in learning spatial
provenance. Some interesting trade-offs between the communication-overhead,
spatial privacy of the vehicles and the error rates in provenance recovery are

multiple participants, who share the same set of samples but hold different
features, jointly train machine learning models. Although VFL enables
collaborative machine learning without sharing raw data, it is still

delving into the privacy threats encountered during different stages of machine
learning and their corresponding countermeasures. This survey not only serves
as a resource for the research community but also offers clear guidance and

many inaccuracies due to misunderstandings of the label taxonomy. In this work,
we present Matcha, an IDE plugin that uses automated code analysis to help
developers create accurate Google Play data safety labels. Developers can
benefit from Matcha's ability to detect user data accesses and transmissions
while staying in control of the generated label by adding custom Java
annotations and modifying an auto-generated XML specification. Our evaluation
with 12 developers showed that Matcha helped our participants improved the
accuracy of a label they created with Google's official tool for a real-world
app they developed. We found that participants preferred Matcha for its
accuracy benefits. Drawing on Matcha, we discuss general design recommendations
for developer tools used to create accurate standardized privacy notices.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper considers the contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with
fairness and privacy guarantees in a federated environment. We consider
merit-based exposure as the desired fair outcome, which provides exposure to
each action in proportion to the reward associated. We model the algorithm's
effectiveness using fairness regret, which captures the difference between fair
optimal policy and the policy output by the algorithm. Applying fair CMAB
algorithm to each agent individually leads to fairness regret linear in the
number of agents. We propose that collaborative -- federated learning can be
more effective and provide the algorithm Fed-FairX-LinUCB that also ensures
differential privacy. The primary challenge in extending the existing privacy
framework is designing the communication protocol for communicating required
information across agents. A naive protocol can either lead to weaker privacy
guarantees or higher regret. We design a novel communication protocol that
allows for (i) Sub-linear theoretical bounds on fairness regret for
Fed-FairX-LinUCB and comparable bounds for the private counterpart,
Priv-FairX-LinUCB (relative to single-agent learning), (ii) Effective use of
privacy budget in Priv-FairX-LinUCB. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed algorithm with extensive simulations-based experiments. We show that
both Fed-FairX-LinUCB and Priv-FairX-LinUCB achieve near-optimal fairness
regret.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze text
comments from Reddit users, aiming to achieve two primary objectives: firstly,
to pinpoint critical excerpts that support a predefined psychological
assessment of suicidal risk; and secondly, to summarize the material to
substantiate the preassigned suicidal risk level. The work is circumscribed to
the use of "open-source" LLMs that can be run locally, thereby enhancing data
privacy. Furthermore, it prioritizes models with low computational
requirements, making it accessible to both individuals and institutions
operating on limited computing budgets. The implemented strategy only relies on
a carefully crafted prompt and a grammar to guide the LLM's text completion.
Despite its simplicity, the evaluation metrics show outstanding results, making
it a valuable privacy-focused and cost-effective approach. This work is part of

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is an important
topic in various fields such as medical and social sciences. CATEs can be
estimated with high accuracy if distributed data across multiple parties can be
centralized. However, it is difficult to aggregate such data if they contain
privacy information. To address this issue, we proposed data collaboration
double machine learning (DC-DML), a method that can estimate CATE models with
privacy preservation of distributed data, and evaluated the method through
numerical experiments. Our contributions are summarized in the following three
points. First, our method enables estimation and testing of semi-parametric
CATE models without iterative communication on distributed data.
Semi-parametric or non-parametric CATE models enable estimation and testing
that is more robust to model mis-specification than parametric models. However,
to our knowledge, no communication-efficient method has been proposed for
estimating and testing semi-parametric or non-parametric CATE models on
distributed data. Second, our method enables collaborative estimation between
different parties as well as multiple time points because the
dimensionality-reduced intermediate representations can be accumulated. Third,
our method performed as well or better than other methods in evaluation
experiments using synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The emergence of large language models (LLMs), and their increased use in
user-facing systems, has led to substantial privacy concerns. To date, research
on these privacy concerns has been model-centered: exploring how LLMs lead to
privacy risks like memorization, or can be used to infer personal
characteristics about people from their content. We argue that there is a need
for more research focusing on the human aspect of these privacy issues: e.g.,
research on how design paradigms for LLMs affect users' disclosure behaviors,
users' mental models and preferences for privacy controls, and the design of
tools, systems, and artifacts that empower end-users to reclaim ownership over
their personal data. To build usable, efficient, and privacy-friendly systems
powered by these models with imperfect privacy properties, our goal is to
initiate discussions to outline an agenda for conducting human-centered
research on privacy issues in LLM-powered systems. This Special Interest Group
(SIG) aims to bring together researchers with backgrounds in usable security
and privacy, human-AI collaboration, NLP, or any other related domains to share
their perspectives and experiences on this problem, to help our community
establish a collective understanding of the challenges, research opportunities,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL), while a breakthrough in decentralized machine
learning, contends with significant challenges such as limited data
availability and the variability of computational resources, which can stifle
the performance and scalability of the models. The integration of Foundation
Models (FMs) into FL presents a compelling solution to these issues, with the
potential to enhance data richness and reduce computational demands through
pre-training and data augmentation. However, this incorporation introduces
novel issues in terms of robustness, privacy, and fairness, which have not been
sufficiently addressed in the existing research. We make a preliminary
investigation into this field by systematically evaluating the implications of
FM-FL integration across these dimensions. We analyze the trade-offs involved,
uncover the threats and issues introduced by this integration, and propose a
set of criteria and strategies for navigating these challenges. Furthermore, we
identify potential research directions for advancing this field, laying a
foundation for future development in creating reliable, secure, and equitable

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the realm of power systems, the increasing involvement of residential
users in load forecasting applications has heightened concerns about data
privacy. Specifically, the load data can inadvertently reveal the daily
routines of residential users, thereby posing a risk to their property
security. While federated learning (FL) has been employed to safeguard user
privacy by enabling model training without the exchange of raw data, these FL
models have shown vulnerabilities to emerging attack techniques, such as Deep
Leakage from Gradients and poisoning attacks. To counteract these, we initially
employ a Secure-Aggregation (SecAgg) algorithm that leverages multiparty
computation cryptographic techniques to mitigate the risk of gradient leakage.
However, the introduction of SecAgg necessitates the deployment of additional
sub-center servers for executing the multiparty computation protocol, thereby
escalating computational complexity and reducing system robustness, especially
in scenarios where one or more sub-centers are unavailable. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Markovian Switching-based distributed training
framework, the convergence of which is substantiated through rigorous
theoretical analysis. The Distributed Markovian Switching (DMS) topology shows
strong robustness towards the poisoning attacks as well. Case studies employing
real-world power system load data validate the efficacy of our proposed
algorithm. It not only significantly minimizes communication complexity but
also maintains accuracy levels comparable to traditional FL methods, thereby
enhancing the scalability of our load forecasting algorithm.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-preserving neural networks have attracted increasing attention in
recent years, and various algorithms have been developed to keep the balance
between accuracy, computational complexity and information security from the
cryptographic view. This work takes a different view from the input data and
structure of neural networks. We decompose the input data (e.g., some images)
into sensitive and insensitive segments according to importance and privacy.
The sensitive segment includes some important and private information such as
human faces and we take strong homomorphic encryption to keep security, whereas
the insensitive one contains some background and we add perturbations. We
propose the bi-CryptoNets, i.e., plaintext and ciphertext branches, to deal
with two segments, respectively, and ciphertext branch could utilize the
information from plaintext branch by unidirectional connections. We adopt
knowledge distillation for our bi-CryptoNets by transferring representations
from a well-trained teacher neural network. Empirical studies show the
effectiveness and decrease of inference latency for our bi-CryptoNets.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Low-resolution infrared (IR) array sensors enable people counting
applications such as monitoring the occupancy of spaces and people flows while
preserving privacy and minimizing energy consumption. Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) have been shown to be well-suited to process these sensor data in an
accurate and efficient manner. Nevertheless, the space of DNNs' architectures
is huge and its manual exploration is burdensome and often leads to sub-optimal
solutions. To overcome this problem, in this work, we propose a highly
automated full-stack optimization flow for DNNs that goes from neural
architecture search, mixed-precision quantization, and post-processing, down to
the realization of a new smart sensor prototype, including a Microcontroller
with a customized instruction set. Integrating these cross-layer optimizations,
we obtain a large set of Pareto-optimal solutions in the 3D-space of energy,
memory, and accuracy. Deploying such solutions on our hardware platform, we
improve the state-of-the-art achieving up to 4.2x model size reduction, 23.8x
code size reduction, and 15.38x energy reduction at iso-accuracy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Fake path injection is an emerging paradigm for inducing privacy over
wireless networks. In this paper, fake paths are injected by the transmitter
into a SIMO multipath communication channel to preserve her physical location
from an eavesdropper. A novel statistical privacy metric is defined as the
ratio between the largest (resp. smallest) eigenvalues of Bob's (resp. Eve's)
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the SIMO multipath channel parameters to assess the
privacy enhancements. Leveraging the spectral properties of generalized
Vandermonde matrices, bounds on the privacy margin of the proposed scheme are
derived. Specifically, it is shown that the privacy margin increases
quadratically in the inverse of the separation between the true and the fake
paths under Eve's perspective. Numerical simulations further showcase the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> During the energy transition, the significance of collaborative management
among institutions is rising, confronting challenges posed by data privacy
concerns. Prevailing research on distributed approaches, as an alternative to
centralized management, often lacks numerical convergence guarantees or is
limited to single-machine numerical simulation. To address this, we present a
distributed approach for solving AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems within a
geographically distributed environment. This involves integrating the energy
system Co-Simulation (eCoSim) module in the eASiMOV framework with the
convergence-guaranteed distributed optimization algorithm, i.e., the Augmented
Lagrangian based Alternating Direction Inexact Newton method (ALADIN).
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple system scenarios reveal a marginal
performance slowdown compared to the centralized approach and the distributed
approach executed on single machines -- a justified trade-off for enhanced data
privacy. This investigation serves as empirical validation of the successful
execution of distributed AC OPF within a geographically distributed
environment, highlighting potential directions for future research.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the mainstream integration of machine learning into security-sensitive
domains such as healthcare and finance, concerns about data privacy have
intensified. Conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been found
vulnerable to several attacks that can leak sensitive data. Particularly, model
inversion (MI) attacks enable the reconstruction of data samples that have been
used to train the model. Neuromorphic architectures have emerged as a paradigm
shift in neural computing, enabling asynchronous and energy-efficient
computation. However, little to no existing work has investigated the privacy
of neuromorphic architectures against model inversion. Our study is motivated
by the intuition that the non-differentiable aspect of spiking neural networks
(SNNs) might result in inherent privacy-preserving properties, especially
against gradient-based attacks. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a
thorough exploration of SNNs' privacy-preserving capabilities. Specifically, we
develop novel inversion attack strategies that are comprehensively designed to
target SNNs, offering a comparative analysis with their conventional ANN
counterparts. Our experiments, conducted on diverse event-based and static
datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies and
therefore questions the assumption of inherent privacy-preserving in
neuromorphic architectures.</p>
