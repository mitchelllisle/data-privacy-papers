    <p><b>Summary:</b> Distributed optimization and learning has recently garnered great attention
due to its wide applications in sensor networks, smart grids, machine learning,
and so forth. Despite rapid development, existing distributed optimization and
learning algorithms require each agent to exchange messages with its neighbors,
which may expose sensitive information and raise significant privacy concerns.
In this survey paper, we overview privacy-preserving distributed optimization
and learning methods. We first discuss cryptography, differential privacy, and
other techniques that can be used for privacy preservation and indicate their
pros and cons for privacy protection in distributed optimization and learning.
We believe that among these approaches, differential privacy is most promising
due to its low computational and communication complexities, which are
extremely appealing for modern learning based applications with high dimensions
of optimization variables. We then introduce several differential-privacy
algorithms that can simultaneously ensure privacy and optimization accuracy.
Moreover, we provide example applications in several machine learning problems
to confirm the real-world effectiveness of these algorithms. Finally, we
highlight some challenges in this research domain and discuss future
directions.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based
models present challenges for socio-technical systems in data requirements and
privacy. Traditional approaches like federated learning distribute the learning
process but strain individual clients, especially with constrained resources
(e.g., edge devices). In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse,
a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and
collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse
enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational
burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU
processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally
expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context,
CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive
information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various
application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare
research, or autonomous driving. In essence, our work advances distributed
machine learning, shaping the future of collaborative GenAI networks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In today's life, more and more people tend to opt for a smart house. In this
way, the idea of including technology has become popular worldwide. Despite
this concept's many benefits, managing security remains an essential problem
due to the shared activities. The Internet of Things system behind a smart
house is based on several sensors to measure temperature, humidity, air
quality, and movement. Because of being supervised every day through sensors
and controlling their house only with a simple click, many people can be afraid
of this new approach in terms of their privacy, and this fact can constrain
them from following their habits. The security aspects should be constantly
analyzed to keep the data's confidentiality and make people feel safe in their
own houses. In this context, the current paper puts light on an alternative
design of a platform in which the safety of homeowners is the primary purpose,
and they maintain complete control over the data generated by smart devices.
The current research highlights the role of security and interface design in
controlling a smart house. The study underscores the importance of providing an
interface that can be used easily by any person to manage data and live
activities in a modern residence in an era dominated by continuously developing
technology.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy is a crucial concern in collaborative machine vision where a part of
a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model runs on the edge, and the rest is executed on
the cloud. In such applications, the machine vision model does not need the
exact visual content to perform its task. Taking advantage of this potential,
private information could be removed from the data insofar as it does not
significantly impair the accuracy of the machine vision system. In this paper,
we present an autoencoder-style network integrated within an object detection
pipeline, which generates a latent representation of the input image that
preserves task-relevant information while removing private information. Our
approach employs an adversarial training strategy that not only removes private
information from the bottleneck of the autoencoder but also promotes improved
compression efficiency for feature channels coded by conventional codecs like
VVC-Intra. We assess the proposed system using a realistic evaluation framework
for privacy, directly measuring face and license plate recognition accuracy.
Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to reduce the
bitrate significantly at the same object detection accuracy compared to coding
the input images directly, while keeping the face and license plate recognition
accuracy on the images recovered from the bottleneck features low, implying
strong privacy protection.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Depression Recognition (DR) poses a considerable challenge, especially in the
context of the growing concerns surrounding privacy. Traditional automatic
diagnosis of DR technology necessitates the use of facial images, undoubtedly
expose the patient identity features and poses privacy risks. In order to
mitigate the potential risks associated with the inappropriate disclosure of
patient facial images, we design a new imaging system to erase the identity
information of captured facial images while retain disease-relevant features.
It is irreversible for identity information recovery while preserving essential
disease-related characteristics necessary for accurate DR. More specifically,
we try to record a de-identified facial image (erasing the identifiable
features as much as possible) by a learnable lens, which is optimized in
conjunction with the following DR task as well as a range of face analysis
related auxiliary tasks in an end-to-end manner. These aforementioned
strategies form our final Optical deep Depression Recognition network
(OpticalDR). Experiments on CelebA, AVEC 2013, and AVEC 2014 datasets
demonstrate that our OpticalDR has achieved state-of-the-art privacy protection
performance with an average AUC of 0.51 on popular facial recognition models,
and competitive results for DR with MAE/RMSE of 7.53/8.48 on AVEC 2013 and
7.89/8.82 on AVEC 2014, respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) have become a pervasive tool for solving many
emerging problems. However, they tend to overfit to and memorize the training
set. Memorization is of keen interest since it is closely related to several
concepts such as generalization, noisy learning, and privacy. To study
memorization, Feldman (2019) proposed a formal score, however its computational
requirements limit its practical use. Recent research has shown empirical
evidence linking input loss curvature (measured by the trace of the loss
Hessian w.r.t inputs) and memorization. It was shown to be ~3 orders of
magnitude more efficient than calculating the memorization score. However,
there is a lack of theoretical understanding linking memorization with input
loss curvature. In this paper, we not only investigate this connection but also
extend our analysis to establish theoretical links between differential
privacy, memorization, and input loss curvature. First, we derive an upper
bound on memorization characterized by both differential privacy and input loss
curvature. Second, we present a novel insight showing that input loss curvature
is upper-bounded by the differential privacy parameter. Our theoretical
findings are further empirically validated using deep models on CIFAR and
ImageNet datasets, showing a strong correlation between our theoretical
predictions and results observed in practice.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In recent years, with the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNN),
more and more graph datasets have been published for GNN tasks. However, when
an upstream data owner publishes graph data, there are often many privacy
concerns, because many real-world graph data contain sensitive information like
person's friend list. Differential privacy (DP) is a common method to protect
privacy, but due to the complex topological structure of graph data, applying
DP on graphs often affects the message passing and aggregation of GNN models,
leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect
graph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically
unchanged. Through reverse learning and the encoder-decoder mechanism, we
search for some false edges that do not have a large negative impact on the
aggregation of node features, and use them to replace some real edges. The
modified graph will be published, which is difficult to distinguish between
real and false data. Sufficient experiments prove that our framework achieves
model accuracy close to the original graph with an extremely low privacy
budget.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> One of the most basic problems for studying the "price of privacy over time"
is the so called private counter problem, introduced by Dwork et al. (2010) and
Chan et al. (2010). In this problem, we aim to track the number of events that
occur over time, while hiding the existence of every single event. More
specifically, in every time step $t\in[T]$ we learn (in an online fashion) that
$\Delta_t\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate
$n_t\approx\sum_{j=1}^t \Delta_j$. The privacy requirement is that all of the
outputs together, across all time steps, satisfy event level differential
privacy. The main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total
number of time steps $T$ and the total number of events $n$. Dwork et al.
(2015) showed an upper bound of $O\left(\log(T)+\log^2(n)\right)$, and
Henzinger et al. (2023) showed a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\{\log n, \log
T\}\right)$. We show a new lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\{n,\log
T\}\right)$, which is tight w.r.t. the dependence on $T$, and is tight in the
sparse case where $\log^2 n=O(\log T)$. Our lower bound has the following
implications:
  $\bullet$ We show that our lower bound extends to the "online thresholds
problem", where the goal is to privately answer many "quantile queries" when
these queries are presented one-by-one. This resolves an open question of Bun
et al. (2017).
  $\bullet$ Our lower bound implies, for the first time, a separation between
the number of mistakes obtainable by a private online learner and a non-private
online learner. This partially resolves a COLT'22 open question published by
Sanyal and Ramponi.
  $\bullet$ Our lower bound also yields the first separation between the
standard model of private online learning and a recently proposed relaxed
variant of it, called private online prediction.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In recent years, the notion of federated learning (FL) has led to the new
paradigm of distributed artificial intelligence (AI) with privacy preservation.
However, most current FL systems suffer from data privacy issues due to the
requirement of a trusted third party. Although some previous works introduce
differential privacy to protect the data, however, it may also significantly
deteriorate the model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel
decentralized collaborative AI framework, named Auditable Homomorphic-based
Decentralised Collaborative AI (AerisAI), to improve security with homomorphic
encryption and fine-grained differential privacy. Our proposed AerisAI directly
aggregates the encrypted parameters with a blockchain-based smart contract to
get rid of the need of a trusted third party. We also propose a brand-new
concept for eliminating the negative impacts of differential privacy for model
performance. Moreover, the proposed AerisAI also provides the broadcast-aware
group key management based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption
(CPABE) to achieve fine-grained access control based on different service-level
agreements. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of the proposed AerisAI as
well as the functionality comparison with the other baselines. We also conduct
extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. The
experimental results indicate that our proposed AerisAI significantly
outperforms the other state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Jha, Martino Trevisan, Marco Mellia, Daniel Fernandez, Rodrigo Irarrazaval</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> In response to growing concerns about user privacy, legislators have
introduced new regulations and laws such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that force
websites to obtain user consent before activating personal data collection,
fundamental to providing targeted advertising. The cornerstone of this
consent-seeking process involves the use of Privacy Banners, the technical
mechanism to collect users' approval for data collection practices. Consent
management platforms (CMPs) have emerged as practical solutions to make it
easier for website administrators to properly manage consent, allowing them to
outsource the complexities of managing user consent and activating advertising
features.
  This paper presents a detailed and longitudinal analysis of the evolution of
CMPs spanning nine years. We take a twofold perspective: Firstly, thanks to the
HTTP Archive dataset, we provide insights into the growth, market share, and
geographical spread of CMPs. Noteworthy observations include the substantial
impact of GDPR on the proliferation of CMPs in Europe. Secondly, we analyse
millions of user interactions with a medium-sized CMP present in thousands of
websites worldwide. We observe how even small changes in the design of Privacy
Banners have a critical impact on the user's giving or denying their consent to
data collection. For instance, over 60% of users do not consent when offered a
simple "one-click reject-all" option. Conversely, when opting out requires more
than one click, about 90% of users prefer to simply give their consent. The
main objective is in fact to eliminate the annoying privacy banner rather the
make an informed decision. Curiously, we observe iOS users exhibit a higher
tendency to accept cookies compared to Android users, possibly indicating
greater confidence in the privacy offered by Apple devices.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in both academia
and industry due to their impressive generative performance in terms of both
sampling quality and distribution coverage. Accordingly, proposals are made for
sharing pre-trained diffusion models across different organizations, as a way
of improving data utilization while enhancing privacy protection by avoiding
sharing private data directly. However, the potential risks associated with
such an approach have not been comprehensively examined.
  In this paper, we take an adversarial perspective to investigate the
potential privacy and fairness risks associated with the sharing of diffusion
models. Specifically, we investigate the circumstances in which one party (the
sharer) trains a diffusion model using private data and provides another party
(the receiver) black-box access to the pre-trained model for downstream tasks.
We demonstrate that the sharer can execute fairness poisoning attacks to
undermine the receiver's downstream models by manipulating the training data
distribution of the diffusion model. Meanwhile, the receiver can perform
property inference attacks to reveal the distribution of sensitive features in
the sharer's dataset. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets
demonstrate remarkable attack performance on different types of diffusion
models, which highlights the critical importance of robust data auditing and
privacy protection protocols in pertinent applications.</p>

regulatory fit on adoption is mediated by trust and privacy calculus processes:
prevention-focused users who read the PPT message trust the tool more.
Furthermore, privacy calculus favors using the tool when promotion-focused

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Programmatically generating tight differential privacy (DP) bounds is a hard
problem. Two core challenges are (1) finding expressive, compact, and efficient
encodings of the distributions of DP algorithms, and (2) state space explosion
stemming from the multiple quantifiers and relational properties of the DP
definition.
  We address the first challenge by developing a method for tight privacy and
accuracy bound synthesis using weighted model counting on binary decision
diagrams, a state of the art technique from the artificial intelligence and
automated reasoning communities for exactly computing probability
distributions. We address the second challenge by developing a framework for
leveraging inherent symmetries in DP algorithms. Our solution benefits from
ongoing research in probabilistic programming languages, allowing us to
succinctly and expressively represent different DP algorithms with approachable
language syntax that can be used by non-experts.
  We provide a detailed case study of our solution on the binary randomized
response algorithm. We also evaluate an implementation of our solution using
the Dice probabilistic programming language for the randomized response and
truncated geometric above threshold algorithms. We compare to prior work on
exact DP verification using Markov chain probabilistic model checking. Very few
existing works consider mechanized analysis of accuracy guarantees for DP
algorithms. We additionally provide a detailed analysis using our technique for
finding tight accuracy bounds for DP algorithms.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As sufficient data are not always publically accessible for model training,
researchers exploit limited data with advanced learning algorithms or expand
the dataset via data augmentation (DA). Conducting DA in private domain
requires private protection approaches (i.e. anonymization and perturbation),
but those methods cannot provide protection guarantees. Differential privacy
(DP) learning methods theoretically bound the protection but are not skilled at
generating pseudo text samples with large models. In this paper, we transfer
DP-based pseudo sample generation task to DP-based generated samples
discrimination task, where we propose a DP-based DA method with a LLM and a
DP-based discriminator for text classification on private domains. We construct
a knowledge distillation model as the DP-based discriminator: teacher models,
accessing private data, teaches students how to select private samples with
calibrated noise to achieve DP. To constrain the distribution of DA's
generation, we propose a DP-based tutor that models the noised private

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) is a new machine learning paradigm to overcome the
challenge of data silos and has garnered significant attention. However,
through our observations, a globally effective trained model may performance
disparities in different clients. This implies that the jointly trained models
by clients may lead to unfair outcomes. On the other hand, relevant studies
indicate that the transmission of gradients or models in federated learning can
also give rise to privacy leakage issues, such as membership inference attacks.
  To address the first issue mentioned above, we propose a federated algorithm
with fairness, termed FedFair. Building upon FedFair, we introduce privacy
protection to form the FedFDP algorithm to address the second issue mentioned
above. In FedFDP, we devise a fairness-aware clipping strategy to achieve
differential privacy while adjusting fairness. Additionally, for the extra
uploaded loss values, we present an adaptive clipping approach to maximize
utility. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that our algorithm converges and
ensures differential privacy. Lastly, Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FedFair and FedFDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
solutions in terms of model performance and fairness. The code is accessible at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this work, maximal $\alpha$-leakage is introduced to quantify how much a
quantum adversary can learn about any sensitive information of data upon
observing its disturbed version via a quantum privacy mechanism. We first show
that an adversary's maximal expected $\alpha$-gain using optimal measurement is
characterized by measured conditional R\'enyi entropy. This can be viewed as a
parametric generalization of K\"onig et al.'s famous guessing probability
formula [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 55(9), 2009]. Then, we prove that the
$\alpha$-leakage and maximal $\alpha$-leakage for a quantum privacy mechanism
are determined by measured Arimoto information and measured R\'enyi capacity,
respectively. Various properties of maximal $\alpha$-leakage, such as data
processing inequality and composition property are established as well.
Moreover, we show that regularized $\alpha$-leakage and regularized maximal
$\alpha$-leakage for identical and independent quantum privacy mechanisms
coincide with $\alpha$-tilted sandwiched R\'enyi information and sandwiched
R\'enyi capacity, respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Ensuring data privacy is a significant challenge for machine learning
applications, not only during model training but also during evaluation.
Federated learning has gained significant research interest in recent years as
a result. Current research on federated learning primarily focuses on
preserving privacy during the training phase. However, model evaluation has not
been adequately addressed, despite the potential for significant privacy leaks
during this phase as well. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
state-of-the-art AUC computation method for federated learning systems, which
utilizes differential privacy, still leaks sensitive information about the test
data while also requiring a trusted central entity to perform the computations.
More importantly, we show that the performance of this method becomes
completely unusable as the data size decreases. In this context, we propose an
efficient, accurate, robust, and more secure evaluation algorithm capable of
computing the AUC in horizontal federated learning systems. Our approach not
only enhances security compared to the current state-of-the-art but also
surpasses the state-of-the-art AUC computation method in both approximation
performance and computational robustness, as demonstrated by experimental
results. To illustrate, our approach can efficiently calculate the AUC of a
federated learning system involving 100 parties, achieving 99.93% accuracy in
just 0.68 seconds, regardless of data size, while providing complete data
privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Transfer learning is a de facto standard method for efficiently training
machine learning models for data-scarce problems by adding and fine-tuning new
classification layers to a model pre-trained on large datasets. Although
numerous previous studies proposed to use homomorphic encryption to resolve the
data privacy issue in transfer learning in the machine learning as a service
setting, most of them only focused on encrypted inference. In this study, we
present HETAL, an efficient Homomorphic Encryption based Transfer Learning
algorithm, that protects the client's privacy in training tasks by encrypting
the client data using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme. HETAL is the
first practical scheme that strictly provides encrypted training, adopting
validation-based early stopping and achieving the accuracy of nonencrypted
training. We propose an efficient encrypted matrix multiplication algorithm,
which is 1.8 to 323 times faster than prior methods, and a highly precise
softmax approximation algorithm with increased coverage. The experimental
results for five well-known benchmark datasets show total training times of
567-3442 seconds, which is less than an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As networked control systems continue to evolve, ensuring the privacy of
sensitive data becomes an increasingly pressing concern, especially in
situations where the controller is physically separated from the plant. In this
paper, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic
control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a
privacy encoder and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two
state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers,
while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design
effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without
sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the
privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the
controllers and the disclosure probability. Additionally, the proposed
privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy.
Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation
method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs. Finally, we
verify the validity of our proposed scheme through simulations.</p>

overlooked in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework
to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent

DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing
algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall
privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such
as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in
combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple
to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines.</p>

to privacy-preserving action recognition. Existing approaches often suffer from
issues arising through obfuscation being applied globally and a lack of
interpretability. Global obfuscation hides privacy sensitive regions, but also
contextual regions important for action recognition. Lack of interpretability
erodes trust in these new technologies. We highlight the limitations of current
paradigms and propose a solution: Human selected privacy templates that yield
interpretability by design, an obfuscation scheme that selectively hides
attributes and also induces temporal consistency, which is important in action
recognition. Our approach is architecture agnostic and directly modifies input
imagery, while existing approaches generally require architecture training. Our
approach offers more flexibility, as no retraining is required, and outperforms
alternatives on three widely used datasets.</p>

is crafted through random channel shuffling, resulting in randomized
recognizable images devoid of attacker-leverageable texture details. We distill
our methodologies into a novel privacy-preserving face recognition method,
MinusFace. Experiments demonstrate its high recognition accuracy and effective

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most popular task-specific
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods on pre-trained language models
for its good performance and computational efficiency. LoRA injects a product
of two trainable rank decomposition matrices over the top of each frozen
pre-trained model module. However, when applied in the setting of
privacy-preserving federated learning (FL), LoRA may become unstable due to the
following facts: 1) the effects of data heterogeneity and multi-step local
updates are non-negligible, 2) additive noise enforced on updating gradients to
guarantee differential privacy (DP) can be amplified and 3) the final
performance is susceptible to hyper-parameters. A key factor leading to these
phenomena is the discordance between jointly optimizing the two low-rank
matrices by local clients and separately aggregating them by the central
server. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient and effective version of LoRA,
Federated Freeze A LoRA (FFA-LoRA), to alleviate these challenges and further
halve the communication cost of federated fine-tuning LLMs. The core idea of
FFA-LoRA is to fix the randomly initialized non-zero matrices and only
fine-tune the zero-initialized matrices. Compared to LoRA, FFA-LoRA is
motivated by practical and theoretical benefits in privacy-preserved FL. Our
experiments demonstrate that FFA-LoRA provides more consistent performance with
better computational efficiency over vanilla LoRA in various FL tasks.</p>

almost neutralizes itself during the aggregation process due to its
correlation, thus minimizing the impact on model accuracy. In addition, ZIP-DL
does not require multiple communication rounds for noise cancellation,
addressing the common trade-off between privacy protection and communication
overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees for both convergence speed and
privacy guarantees, thereby making ZIP-DL applicable to practical scenarios.
Our extensive experimental study shows that ZIP-DL achieves the best trade-off
between vulnerability and accuracy. In particular, ZIP-DL (i) reduces the
effectiveness of a linkability attack by up to 52 points compared to baseline

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data
utility by producing ``out-of-bound'' noisy results for a tight privacy budget.
We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework,
designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP
mechanisms. By ``soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release
most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and
maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two
components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per
iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or
releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP,
culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally
sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler.
Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition
scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy
leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept
of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose
optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with

and privacy being two prominent challenges. In this paper, we address both
issues within a federated transfer learning framework, aiming to enhance
learning on a target data set by leveraging information from multiple
heterogeneous source data sets while adhering to privacy constraints. We
rigorously formulate the notion of \textit{federated differential privacy},
which offers privacy guarantees for each data set without assuming a trusted
central server. Under this privacy constraint, we study three classical
statistical problems, namely univariate mean estimation, low-dimensional linear
regression, and high-dimensional linear regression. By investigating the
minimax rates and identifying the costs of privacy for these problems, we show
that federated differential privacy is an intermediate privacy model between
the well-established local and central models of differential privacy. Our
analyses incorporate data heterogeneity and privacy, highlighting the
fundamental costs of both in federated learning and underscoring the benefit of
knowledge transfer across data sets.</p>

used in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Tangle can be configured by
utilizing the tip selection process. Due to performance issues with light

However, in this paper, we demonstrate that tip selection can be exploited to
compromise users' privacy. An adversary full node can associate a transaction
with the identity of a light node by comparing the light node's request with
its ledger. We show that these types of attacks are not only viable in the
current IOTA environment but also in IOTA 2.0 and the privacy improvement being

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks (PPNN) are advanced to perform inference
without breaching user privacy, which can serve as an essential tool for
medical diagnosis to simultaneously achieve big data utility and privacy
protection. As one of the key techniques to enable PPNN, Fully Homomorphic
Encryption (FHE) is facing a great challenge that homomorphic operations cannot
be easily adapted for non-linear activation calculations. In this paper,
batch-oriented element-wise data packing and approximate activation are
proposed, which train linear low-degree polynomials to approximate the
non-linear activation function - ReLU. Compared with other approximate
activation methods, the proposed fine-grained, trainable approximation scheme
can effectively reduce the accuracy loss caused by approximation errors.
Meanwhile, due to element-wise data packing, a large batch of images can be
packed and inferred concurrently, leading to a much higher utility ratio of
ciphertext slots. Therefore, although the total inference time increases
sharply, the amortized time for each image actually decreases, especially when
the batch size increases. Furthermore, knowledge distillation is adopted in the
training process to further enhance the inference accuracy. Experiment results
show that when ciphertext inference is performed on 4096 input images, compared
with the current most efficient channel-wise method, the inference accuracy is
improved by 1.65%, and the amortized inference time is reduced by 99.5%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Consider the problem of storing data in a distributed manner over $T$
servers. Specifically, the data needs to (i) be recoverable from any $\tau$
servers, and (ii) remain private from any $z$ colluding servers, where privacy
is quantified in terms of mutual information between the data and all the
information available at any $z$ colluding servers. For this model, our main
results are (i) the fundamental trade-off between storage size and the level of
desired privacy, and (ii) the optimal amount of local randomness necessary at
the encoder. As a byproduct, our results provide an optimal lower bound on the
individual share size of ramp secret sharing schemes under a more general
leakage symmetry condition than the ones previously considered in the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We present SocialGenPod, a decentralised and privacy-friendly way of
deploying generative AI Web applications. Unlike centralised Web and data
architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we
show how one can use Solid -- a decentralised Web specification -- to decouple
user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a
prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models,
optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers
grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed
to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access
control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to
data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app
configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod;
separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy
controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and
applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute
requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area
should address. Our prototype is open-source and available at:

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This work studies a privacy metric based on Chernoff information,
\textit{Chernoff differential privacy}, due to its significance in
characterization of classifier performance. Adversarial classification, as any
other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or
correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in
the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing
problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled
separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in
this work, we focus on the Bayesian setting and characterize the relationship
between the best error exponent of the average error probability and
$\varepsilon-$differential privacy. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff
differential privacy in terms of $\varepsilon-$differential privacy using the
Radon-Nikodym derivative and show that it satisfies the composition property.
Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that
Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of
the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$, the impact of the adversary's attack and
global sensitivity for the problem of adversarial classification in Laplace
mechanisms.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differentially private mechanisms achieving worst-case optimal error bounds
(e.g., the classical Laplace mechanism) are well-studied in the literature.
However, when typical data are far from the worst case,
\emph{instance-specific} error bounds -- which depend on the largest value in
the dataset -- are more meaningful. For example, consider the sum estimation
problem, where each user has an integer $x_i$ from the domain $\{0,1,\dots,U\}$
and we wish to estimate $\sum_i x_i$. This has a worst-case optimal error of
$O(U/\varepsilon)$, while recent work has shown that the clipping mechanism can
achieve an instance-optimal error of $O(\max_i x_i \cdot \log\log U
/\varepsilon)$. Under the shuffle model, known instance-optimal protocols are
less communication-efficient. The clipping mechanism also works in the shuffle
model, but requires two rounds: Round one finds the clipping threshold, and
round two does the clipping and computes the noisy sum of the clipped data. In
this paper, we show how these two seemingly sequential steps can be done
simultaneously in one round using just $1+o(1)$ messages per user, while
maintaining the instance-optimal error bound. We also extend our technique to
the high-dimensional sum estimation problem and sparse vector aggregation
(a.k.a. frequency estimation under user-level differential privacy). Our
experiments show order-of-magnitude improvements of our protocols in terms of
error compared with prior work.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the healthcare domain, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assumes a pivotal
role, as it employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
methodologies to extract invaluable insights from imaging data. Nonetheless,
the imperative need for patient privacy poses significant challenges when
collecting data from diverse healthcare sources. Consequently, the Deep
Learning (DL) communities occasionally face difficulties detecting rare
features. In this research endeavor, we introduce the Ensemble-Based Federated
Learning (EBFL) Framework, an innovative solution tailored to address this
challenge. The EBFL framework deviates from the conventional approach by
emphasizing model features over sharing sensitive patient data. This unique
methodology fosters a collaborative and privacy-conscious environment for
healthcare institutions, empowering them to harness the capabilities of a
centralized server for model refinement while upholding the utmost data privacy
standards.Conversely, a robust ensemble architecture boasts potent feature
extraction capabilities, distinguishing itself from a single DL model. This
quality makes it remarkably dependable for MRI analysis. By harnessing our
groundbreaking EBFL methodology, we have achieved remarkable precision in the
classification of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and
non-tumor instances, attaining a precision rate of 94% for the Global model and
an impressive 96% for the Ensemble model. Our models underwent rigorous
evaluation using conventional performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision,
Recall, and F1 Score. Integrating DL within the Federated Learning (FL)
framework has yielded a methodology that offers precise and dependable

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixuan Liu, Tianhao Wang, Yang Cao, Li Xiong</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has demonstrated its effectiveness
and has become the standard approach for tailoring language models to various
tasks. Currently, community-based platforms offer easy access to various
pre-trained models, as anyone can publish without strict validation processes.
However, a released pre-trained model can be a privacy trap for fine-tuning
datasets if it is carefully designed. In this work, we propose PreCurious
framework to reveal the new attack surface where the attacker releases the
pre-trained model and gets a black-box access to the final fine-tuned model.
PreCurious aims to escalate the general privacy risk of both membership
inference and data extraction. The key intuition behind PreCurious is to
manipulate the memorization stage of the pre-trained model and guide
fine-tuning with a seemingly legitimate configuration. The effectiveness of
defending against privacy attacks on a fine-tuned model seems promising, as
empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that parameter-efficient and
differentially private fine-tuning techniques are invulnerable to privacy
attacks. But PreCurious demonstrates the possibility of breaking up
invulnerability in a stealthy manner compared to fine-tuning on a benign model.
By further leveraging a sanitized dataset, PreCurious can extract originally
unexposed secrets under differentially private fine-tuning. Thus, PreCurious
raises warnings for users who download pre-trained models from unknown sources,
rely solely on tutorials or common-sense defenses, and previously release
sanitized datasets even after perfect scrubbing.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While diffusion models have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in
generating realistic images, privacy risks also arise: published models or APIs
could generate training images and thus leak privacy-sensitive training
information. In this paper, we reveal a new risk, Shake-to-Leak (S2L), that
fine-tuning the pre-trained models with manipulated data can amplify the
existing privacy risks. We demonstrate that S2L could occur in various standard
fine-tuning strategies for diffusion models, including concept-injection
methods (DreamBooth and Textual Inversion) and parameter-efficient methods
(LoRA and Hypernetwork), as well as their combinations. In the worst case, S2L
can amplify the state-of-the-art membership inference attack (MIA) on diffusion
models by $5.4\%$ (absolute difference) AUC and can increase extracted private
samples from almost $0$ samples to $16.3$ samples on average per target domain.
This discovery underscores that the privacy risk with diffusion models is even
more severe than previously recognized. Codes are available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Local differential privacy (LDP), which enables an untrusted server to
collect aggregated statistics from distributed users while protecting the
privacy of those users, has been widely deployed in practice. However, LDP
protocols for frequency estimation are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in
which an attacker can poison the aggregated frequencies by manipulating the
data sent from malicious users. Therefore, it is an open challenge to recover
the accurate aggregated frequencies from poisoned ones.
  In this work, we propose LDPRecover, a method that can recover accurate
aggregated frequencies from poisoning attacks, even if the server does not
learn the details of the attacks. In LDPRecover, we establish a genuine
frequency estimator that theoretically guides the server to recover the
frequencies aggregated from genuine users' data by eliminating the impact of
malicious users' data in poisoned frequencies. Since the server has no idea of
the attacks, we propose an adaptive attack to unify existing attacks and learn
the statistics of the malicious data within this adaptive attack by exploiting
the properties of LDP protocols. By taking the estimator and the learning
statistics as constraints, we formulate the problem of recovering aggregated
frequencies to approach the genuine ones as a constraint inference (CI)
problem. Consequently, the server can obtain accurate aggregated frequencies by
solving this problem optimally. Moreover, LDPRecover can serve as a frequency
recovery paradigm that recovers more accurate aggregated frequencies by
integrating attack details as new constraints in the CI problem. Our evaluation
on two real-world datasets, three LDP protocols, and untargeted and targeted
poisoning attacks shows that LDPRecover is both accurate and widely applicable
against various poisoning attacks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> IoT devices have become indispensable components of our lives, and the
advancement of AI technologies will make them even more pervasive, increasing
the vulnerability to malfunctions or cyberattacks and raising privacy concerns.
Encryption can mitigate these challenges; however, most existing anomaly
detection techniques decrypt the data to perform the analysis, potentially
undermining the encryption protection provided during transit or storage.
Homomorphic encryption schemes are promising solutions as they enable the
processing and execution of operations on IoT data while still encrypted,
however, these schemes offer only limited operations, which poses challenges to
their practical usage. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving
anomaly detection solution designed for homomorphically encrypted data
generated by IoT devices that efficiently detects abnormal values without
performing decryption. We have adapted the Histogram-based anomaly detection
technique for TFHE scheme to address limitations related to the input size and
the depth of computation by implementing vectorized support operations. These
operations include addition, value placement in buckets, labeling abnormal
buckets based on a threshold frequency, labeling abnormal values based on their
range, and bucket labels. Evaluation results show that the solution effectively
detects anomalies without requiring data decryption and achieves consistent
results comparable to the mechanism operating on plain data. Also, it shows
robustness and resilience against various challenges commonly encountered in
IoT environments, such as noisy sensor data, adversarial attacks, communication
failures, and device malfunctions. Moreover, the time and computational
overheads determined for several solution configurations, despite being large,
are reasonable compared to those reported in existing literature.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) transcends traditional medical
boundaries, enabling a transition from reactive treatment to proactive
prevention. This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating
early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease
management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data
collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security
challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and
value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover,
the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical
data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies
may arise due to human errors, network interference, or hardware malfunctions.
In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an
interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of
explicability and protection of privacy. To address these challenges, a new
framework for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is introduced, leveraging
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for intrusion detection while utilizing
Federated Learning (FL) for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are incorporated to enhance model
explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is
evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets
containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological
data. The results obtained offer compelling evidence that the FL method
performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance.
Additionally, it affords the dual advantage of safeguarding privacy and
providing model explanation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important
issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in
images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and
ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy
of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection
task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy
object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object
detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies
in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating
large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing
privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy
detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two
issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection
and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model
constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes
self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through
experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object
detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The utilization of personal sensitive data in training face recognition (FR)
models poses significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can employ model
inversion attacks (MIA) to infer the original training data. Existing defense
methods, such as data augmentation and differential privacy, have been employed
to mitigate this issue. However, these methods often fail to strike an optimal
balance between privacy and accuracy. To address this limitation, this paper
introduces an adaptive hybrid masking algorithm against MIA. Specifically, face
images are masked in the frequency domain using an adaptive MixUp strategy.
Unlike the traditional MixUp algorithm, which is predominantly used for data
augmentation, our modified approach incorporates frequency domain mixing.
Previous studies have shown that increasing the number of images mixed in MixUp
can enhance privacy preservation but at the expense of reduced face recognition
accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we develop an enhanced adaptive MixUp
strategy based on reinforcement learning, which enables us to mix a larger
number of images while maintaining satisfactory recognition accuracy. To
optimize privacy protection, we propose maximizing the reward function (i.e.,
the loss function of the FR system) during the training of the strategy
network. While the loss function of the FR network is minimized in the phase of
training the FR network. The strategy network and the face recognition network
can be viewed as antagonistic entities in the training process, ultimately
reaching a more balanced trade-off. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed hybrid masking scheme outperforms existing defense algorithms in terms
of privacy preservation and recognition accuracy against MIA.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As artificial intelligence continues its unprecedented global expansion,
accompanied by a proliferation of benefits, an increasing apprehension about
the privacy and security implications of AI-enabled systems emerges. The
pivotal question of effectively controlling AI development at both
jurisdictional and organizational levels has become a prominent theme in
contemporary discourse. While the European Parliament and Council have taken a
decisive step by reaching a political agreement on the EU AI Act, the first
comprehensive AI law, organizations still find it challenging to adapt to the
fast-evolving AI landscape, lacking a universal tool for evaluating the privacy
and security dimensions of their AI models and systems. In response to this
critical challenge, this study conducts a systematic literature review spanning
the years 2020 to 2023, with a primary focus on establishing a unified
definition of key concepts in AI Ethics, particularly emphasizing the domains
of privacy and security. Through the synthesis of knowledge extracted from the
SLR, this study presents a conceptual framework tailored for privacy- and
security-aware AI systems. This framework is designed to assist diverse
stakeholders, including organizations, academic institutions, and governmental
bodies, in both the development and critical assessment of AI systems.
Essentially, the proposed framework serves as a guide for ethical
decision-making, fostering an environment wherein AI is developed and utilized
with a strong commitment to ethical principles. In addition, the study unravels
the key issues and challenges surrounding the privacy and security dimensions,
delineating promising avenues for future research, thereby contributing to the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Cellular networks are not merely data access networks to the Internet. Their
distinct services and ability to form large complex compounds for roaming
purposes make them an attractive research target in their own right. Their
promise of providing a consistent service with comparable privacy and security
across roaming partners falls apart at close inspection.
  Thus, there is a need for controlled testbeds and measurement tools for
cellular access networks doing justice to the technology's unique structure and
global scope. Particularly, such measurements suffer from a combinatorial
explosion of operators, mobile plans, and services. To cope with these
challenges, we built a framework that geographically decouples the SIM from the
cellular modem by selectively connecting both remotely. This allows testing any
subscriber with any operator at any modem location within minutes without
moving parts. The resulting GSM/UMTS/LTE measurement and testbed platform
offers a controlled experimentation environment, which is scalable and
cost-effective. The platform is extensible and fully open-sourced, allowing
other researchers to contribute locations, SIM cards, and measurement scripts.
  Using the above framework, our international experiments in commercial
networks revealed exploitable inconsistencies in traffic metering, leading to
multiple phreaking opportunities, i.e., fare-dodging. We also expose
problematic IPv6 firewall configurations, hidden SIM card communication to the
home network, and fingerprint dial progress tones to track victims across

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We introduce a novel approach to make the tracking error of a class of
nonlinear systems differentially private in addition to guaranteeing the
tracking error performance. We use funnel control to make the tracking error
evolve within a performance funnel that is pre-specified by the user. We make
the performance funnel differentially private by adding a bounded continuous
noise generated from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type process. Since the funnel
controller is a function of the performance funnel, the noise adds randomized
perturbation to the control input. We show that, as a consequence of the
differential privacy of the performance funnel, the tracking error is also
differentially private. As a result, the tracking error is bounded by the noisy
funnel boundary while maintaining privacy. We show a simulation result to
demonstrate the framework.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy policies are expected to inform data subjects about their data
protection rights. They should explain the data controller's data management
practices, and make facts such as retention periods or data transfers to third
parties transparent. Privacy policies only fulfill their purpose, if they are
correctly perceived, interpreted, understood, and trusted by the data subject.
Amongst others, this requires that a privacy policy is written in a fair way,
e.g., it does not use polarizing terms, does not require a certain education,
or does not assume a particular social background. In this work-in-progress
paper, we outline our approach to assessing fairness in privacy policies. To
this end, we identify from fundamental legal sources and fairness research, how
the dimensions informational fairness, representational fairness and
ethics/morality are related to privacy policies. We propose options to
automatically assess policies in these fairness dimensions, based on text
statistics, linguistic methods and artificial intelligence. Finally, we conduct
initial experiments with German privacy policies to provide evidence that our
approach is applicable. Our experiments indicate that there are indeed issues
in all three dimensions of fairness. For example, our approach finds out if a
policy discriminates against individuals with impaired reading skills or
certain demographics, and identifies questionable ethics. This is important, as
future privacy policies may be used in a corpus for legal artificial
intelligence models.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Synthetic data from generative models emerges as the privacy-preserving
data-sharing solution. Such a synthetic data set shall resemble the original
data without revealing identifiable private information. The backbone
technology of tabular synthesizers is rooted in image generative models,
ranging from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recent diffusion models.
Recent prior work sheds light on the utility-privacy tradeoff on tabular data,
revealing and quantifying privacy risks on synthetic data. We first conduct an
exhaustive empirical analysis, highlighting the utility-privacy tradeoff of
five state-of-the-art tabular synthesizers, against eight privacy attacks, with
a special focus on membership inference attacks. Motivated by the observation
of high data quality but also high privacy risk in tabular diffusion, we
propose DP-TLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which
is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent
diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP
framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch
clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture
the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that
DP-TLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee
while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically,
compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DP-TLDM improves the
synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility
for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a
comparable level of privacy risk.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-preserving computing is crucial for multi-center machine learning in
many applications such as healthcare and finance. In this paper a Multi-center
Privacy Computing framework with Predictions Aggregation (MPCPA) based on
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is proposed, in which
conditional diffusion model training, DDPM data generation, a classifier, and
strategy of prediction aggregation are included. Compared to federated
learning, this framework necessitates fewer communications and leverages
high-quality generated data to support robust privacy computing. Experimental
validation across multiple datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework
outperforms classic federated learning and approaches the performance of
centralized learning with original data. Moreover, our approach demonstrates
robust security, effectively addressing challenges such as image memorization
and membership inference attacks. Our experiments underscore the efficacy of
the proposed framework in the realm of privacy computing, with the code set to
be released soon.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Introducing Small Cell Networks (SCN) has significantly improved wireless
link quality, spectrum efficiency and network capacity, which has been viewed
as one of the key technologies in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile network.
However, this technology increases the frequency of handover (HO) procedures
caused by the dense deployment of cells in the network with reduced cell
coverage, bringing new security and privacy issues. The current 5G-AKA and HO
protocols are vulnerable to security weaknesses, such as the lack of forward
secrecy and identity confusion attacks. The high HO frequency of HOs might
magnify these security and privacy concerns in the 5G mobile network. This work
addresses these issues by proposing a secure privacy-preserving universal HO
scheme ($\UniHand$) for SCNs in 5G mobile communication. $\UniHand$ can achieve
mutual authentication, strong anonymity, perfect forward secrecy,
key-escrow-free and key compromise impersonation (KCI) resilience. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the \textit{first} scheme to achieve secure,
privacy-preserving universal HO with \textit{KCI} resilience for roaming users
in 5G environment. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is resilient against
all the essential security threats by performing a comprehensive formal
security analysis and conducting relevant experiments to show the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In recent years, differential privacy has been adopted by tech-companies and
governmental agencies as the standard for measuring privacy in algorithms. We
study the level of differential privacy in Bayesian posterior sampling setups.
As opposed to the common privatization approach of injecting Laplace/Gaussian
noise into the output, Huber's contamination model is considered, where we
replace at random the data points with samples from a heavy-tailed
distribution. We derived bounds for the differential privacy level
$(\epsilon,\delta)$ for our approach while lifting the common restriction on
assuming bounded observation and parameter space seen in the existing
literature. We further consider the effect of sample size on privacy level and
the convergence rate of $(\epsilon,\delta)$ to zero. Asymptotically, the
contamination approach is fully private at no cost of information loss. We also
provide some examples depicting inference models that our setup is applicable
to with a theoretical estimation of convergence rate.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Image reconstruction attacks on machine learning models pose a significant
risk to privacy by potentially leaking sensitive information. Although
defending against such attacks using differential privacy (DP) has proven
effective, determining appropriate DP parameters remains challenging. Current
formal guarantees on data reconstruction success suffer from overly theoretical
assumptions regarding adversary knowledge about the target data, particularly
in the image domain. In this work, we empirically investigate this discrepancy
and find that the practicality of these assumptions strongly depends on the
domain shift between the data prior and the reconstruction target. We propose a
reconstruction attack based on diffusion models (DMs) that assumes adversary
access to real-world image priors and assess its implications on privacy
leakage under DP-SGD. We show that (1) real-world data priors significantly
influence reconstruction success, (2) current reconstruction bounds do not
model the risk posed by data priors well, and (3) DMs can serve as effective
auditing tools for visualizing privacy leakage.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Protecting individual privacy is crucial when releasing sensitive data for
public use. While data de-identification helps, it is not enough. This paper
addresses parameter estimation in scenarios where data are perturbed using the
Post-Randomization Method (PRAM) to enhance privacy. Existing methods for
parameter estimation under PRAM data suffer from limitations like being
parameter-specific, model-dependent, and lacking efficiency guarantees. We
propose a novel, efficient method that overcomes these limitations. Our method
is applicable to general parameters defined through estimating equations and
makes no assumptions about the underlying data model. We further prove that the
proposed estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, making it
optimal in terms of asymptotic variance.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While location trajectories represent a valuable data source for analyses and
location-based services, they can reveal sensitive information, such as
political and religious preferences. Differentially private publication
mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy
guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting
privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction
attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising
alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve
remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This
paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory
publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the
importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework,
we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising
their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the
state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the
proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all
requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the
applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain.
Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic
guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps
for future research.</p>

Unfortunately, the model accuracy benefits of collaboration are often
undermined by privacy defenses. Therefore, to incentivize client participation
in privacy-sensitive domains, a FL protocol should strike a delicate balance
between privacy guarantees and end-model accuracy. In this paper, we study the
question of when and how a server could design a FL protocol provably
beneficial for all participants. First, we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of mutually beneficial protocols in the context of
mean estimation and convex stochastic optimization. We also derive protocols
that maximize the total clients' utility, given symmetric privacy preferences.
Finally, we design protocols maximizing end-model accuracy and demonstrate
their benefits in synthetic experiments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent years have seen a sharp increase in underage users of virtual reality
(VR), where security and privacy (S\&P) risks such as data surveillance and
self-disclosure in social interaction have been increasingly prominent. Prior
work shows children largely rely on parents to mitigate S\&P risks in their
technology use. Therefore, understanding parents' S\&P knowledge, perceptions,
and practices is critical for identifying the gaps for parents, technology
designers, and policymakers to enhance children's S\&P. While such empirical
knowledge is substantial in other consumer technologies, it remains largely
unknown in the context of VR. To address the gap, we conducted in-depth
semi-structured interviews with 20 parents of children under the age of 18 who
use VR at home. Our findings highlight parents generally lack S\&P awareness
due to the perception that VR is still in its infancy. To protect their
children's interaction with VR, parents currently primarily rely on active
strategies such as verbal education about S\&P. Passive strategies such as
parental controls in VR are not commonly used among our interviewees, mainly
due to their perceived technical constraints. Parents also highlight that a
multi-stakeholder ecosystem must be established towards more S\&P support for
children in VR. Based on the findings, we propose actionable S\&P
recommendations for critical stakeholders, including parents, educators, VR
companies, and governments.</p>

collecting diverse, high-quality instruction data for tuning poses challenges,
particularly in privacy-sensitive domains. Federated instruction tuning (FedIT)
has emerged as a solution, leveraging federated learning from multiple data

address these issues, we propose a novel federated algorithm, FedPIT, which
utilizes LLMs' in-context learning capability to self-generate task-specific
synthetic data for training autonomously. Our method employs parameter-isolated
training to maintain global parameters trained on synthetic data and local
parameters trained on augmented local data, effectively thwarting data

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Reinforcement Learning (RL) has increasingly become a preferred method over
traditional rule-based systems in diverse human-in-the-loop (HITL) applications
due to its adaptability to the dynamic nature of human interactions. However,
integrating RL in such settings raises significant privacy concerns, as it
might inadvertently expose sensitive user information. Addressing this, our
paper focuses on developing PAPER-HILT, an innovative, adaptive RL strategy
through exploiting an early-exit approach designed explicitly for privacy
preservation in HITL environments. This approach dynamically adjusts the
tradeoff between privacy protection and system utility, tailoring its operation
to individual behavioral patterns and preferences. We mainly highlight the
challenge of dealing with the variable and evolving nature of human behavior,
which renders static privacy models ineffective. PAPER-HILT's effectiveness is
evaluated through its application in two distinct contexts: Smart Home
environments and Virtual Reality (VR) Smart Classrooms. The empirical results
demonstrate PAPER-HILT's capability to provide a personalized equilibrium

on protecting the denoising phase of the diffusion process. HE-Diffusion is a
tailored encryption framework specifically designed to align with the unique
architecture of stable diffusion, ensuring both privacy and functionality. To
address the inherent computational challenges, we propose a novel
min-distortion method that enables efficient partial image encryption,
significantly reducing the overhead without compromising the model's output
quality. Furthermore, we adopt a sparse tensor representation to expedite
computational operations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the
privacy-preserving diffusion process. We successfully implement HE-based
privacy-preserving stable diffusion inference. The experimental results show
that HE-Diffusion achieves 500 times speedup compared with the baseline method,
and reduces time cost of the homomorphically encrypted inference to the minute
level. Both the performance and accuracy of the HE-Diffusion are on par with
the plaintext counterpart. Our approach marks a significant step towards

exchanging runtime metrics between collaborating organizations. Yet, not all

  We present a privacy-preserving approach for sharing runtime metrics based on
differential privacy and data synthesis. Our evaluation on performance data
from 736 Spark job executions indicates that fully anonymized training data
largely maintains performance prediction accuracy, particularly when there is
minimal original data available. With 30 or fewer available original data

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The state-of-the-art face recognition systems are typically trained on a
single computer, utilizing extensive image datasets collected from various
number of users. However, these datasets often contain sensitive personal
information that users may hesitate to disclose. To address potential privacy
concerns, we explore the application of federated learning, both with and
without secure aggregators, in the context of both supervised and unsupervised
face recognition systems. Federated learning facilitates the training of a
shared model without necessitating the sharing of individual private data,
achieving this by training models on decentralized edge devices housing the
data. In our proposed system, each edge device independently trains its own
model, which is subsequently transmitted either to a secure aggregator or
directly to the central server. To introduce diverse data without the need for
data transmission, we employ generative adversarial networks to generate
imposter data at the edge. Following this, the secure aggregator or central
server combines these individual models to construct a global model, which is
then relayed back to the edge devices. Experimental findings based on the
CelebA datasets reveal that employing federated learning in both supervised and
unsupervised face recognition systems offers dual benefits. Firstly, it
safeguards privacy since the original data remains on the edge devices.
Secondly, the experimental results demonstrate that the aggregated model yields
nearly identical performance compared to the individual models, particularly
when the federated model does not utilize a secure aggregator. Hence, our
results shed light on the practical challenges associated with
privacy-preserving face image training, particularly in terms of the balance

protocol presents a novel approach to secure, private, and scalable elections,
extending the TrueElect and ElectAnon protocols with the integration of
AnonCreds SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity). Such a protocol PoC is situated within
a Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) and leverages confidential computing,
continuous authentication, multi-party computation (MPC), and well-architected
framework (WAF) principles to address the challenges of cybersecurity, privacy,
and trust over IP (ToIP) protection. Employing a Kubernetes confidential
cluster within an Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone (ESLZ), vSPACE integrates
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for immutable and certifiable audit trails.
The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model ensures rapid deployment, consistent
management, and adherence to security standards, making vSPACE a future-proof
solution for digital voting systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Decentralised identifiers have become a standardised element of digital
identity architecture, with supra-national organisations such as the European
Union adopting them as a key component for a unified European digital identity
ledger. This paper delves into enhancing security and privacy features within
decentralised identifiers by integrating ring signatures as an alternative
verification method. This allows users to identify themselves through digital
signatures without revealing which public key they used. To this end, the study
proposed a novel decentralised identity method showcased in a decentralised
identifier-based architectural framework. Additionally, the investigation
assesses the repercussions of employing this new method in the verification
process, focusing specifically on privacy and security aspects. Although ring
signatures are an established asset of cryptographic protocols, this paper

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large language models (LLMs) are complex artificial intelligence systems
capable of understanding, generating and translating human language. They learn
language patterns by analyzing large amounts of text data, allowing them to
perform writing, conversation, summarizing and other language tasks. When LLMs
process and generate large amounts of data, there is a risk of leaking
sensitive information, which may threaten data privacy. This paper concentrates
on elucidating the data privacy concerns associated with LLMs to foster a
comprehensive understanding. Specifically, a thorough investigation is
undertaken to delineate the spectrum of data privacy threats, encompassing both
passive privacy leakage and active privacy attacks within LLMs. Subsequently,
we conduct an assessment of the privacy protection mechanisms employed by LLMs
at various stages, followed by a detailed examination of their efficacy and
constraints. Finally, the discourse extends to delineate the challenges
encountered and outline prospective directions for advancement in the realm of
LLM privacy protection.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Ensuring fairness in deep-learning-based segmentors is crucial for health
equity. Much effort has been dedicated to mitigating unfairness in the training
datasets or procedures. However, with the increasing prevalence of foundation
models in medical image analysis, it is hard to train fair models from scratch
while preserving utility. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Adversarial
Privacy-aware Perturbations on Latent Embedding (APPLE), that can improve the
fairness of deployed segmentors by introducing a small latent feature perturber
without updating the weights of the original model. By adding perturbation to
the latent vector, APPLE decorates the latent vector of segmentors such that no
fairness-related features can be passed to the decoder of the segmentors while
preserving the architecture and parameters of the segmentor. Experiments on two
segmentation datasets and five segmentors (three U-Net-like and two SAM-like)
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several
unfairness mitigation methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Data-dependent privacy accounting frameworks such as per-instance
differential privacy (pDP) and Fisher information loss (FIL) confer
fine-grained privacy guarantees for individuals in a fixed training dataset.
These guarantees can be desirable compared to vanilla DP in real world settings
as they tightly upper-bound the privacy leakage for a $\textit{specific}$
individual in an $\textit{actual}$ dataset, rather than considering worst-case
datasets. While these frameworks are beginning to gain popularity, to date,
there is a lack of private mechanisms that can fully leverage advantages of
data-dependent accounting. To bridge this gap, we propose simple modifications
of the Gaussian mechanism with bounded support, showing that they amplify
privacy guarantees under data-dependent accounting. Experiments on model
training with DP-SGD show that using bounded support Gaussian mechanisms can
provide a reduction of the pDP bound $\epsilon$ by as much as 30% without
negative effects on model utility.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy (DP) has various desirable properties, such as
robustness to post-processing, group privacy, and amplification by subsampling,
which can be derived independently of each other. Our goal is to determine
whether stronger privacy guarantees can be obtained by considering multiple of
these properties jointly. To this end, we focus on the combination of group
privacy and amplification by subsampling. To provide guarantees that are
amenable to machine learning algorithms, we conduct our analysis in the
framework of R\'enyi-DP, which has more favorable composition properties than
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. As part of this analysis, we develop a unified
framework for deriving amplification by subsampling guarantees for R\'enyi-DP,
which represents the first such framework for a privacy accounting method and
is of independent interest. We find that it not only lets us improve upon and
generalize existing amplification results for R\'enyi-DP, but also derive
provably tight group privacy amplification guarantees stronger than existing
principles. These results establish the joint study of different DP properties

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Cloud computing enables users to process and store data remotely on
high-performance computers and servers by sharing data over the Internet.
However, transferring data to clouds causes unavoidable privacy concerns. Here,
we present a synthesis framework to design coding mechanisms that allow sharing
and processing data in a privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing data
utility and algorithmic performance. We consider the setup where the user aims
to run an algorithm in the cloud using private data. The cloud then returns
some data utility back to the user (utility refers to the service that the
algorithm provides, e.g., classification, prediction, AI models, etc.). To
avoid privacy concerns, the proposed scheme provides tools to co-design: 1)
coding mechanisms to distort the original data and guarantee a prescribed
differential privacy level; 2) an equivalent-but-different algorithm (referred
here to as the target algorithm) that runs on distorted data and produces
distorted utility; and 3) a decoding function that extracts the true utility
from the distorted one with a negligible error. Then, instead of sharing the
original data and algorithm with the cloud, only the distorted data and target
algorithm are disclosed, thereby avoiding privacy concerns. The proposed scheme
is built on the synergy of differential privacy and system immersion tools from
control theory. The key underlying idea is to design a higher-dimensional
target algorithm that embeds all trajectories of the original algorithm and
works on randomly encoded data to produce randomly encoded utility. We show
that the proposed scheme can be designed to offer any level of differential
privacy without degrading the algorithm's utility. We present two use cases to
illustrate the performance of the developed tools: privacy in
optimization/learning algorithms and a nonlinear networked control system.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Graph-structured data exhibits universality and widespread applicability
across diverse domains, such as social network analysis, biochemistry,
financial fraud detection, and network security. Significant strides have been
made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success
in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for
models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation
of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data
distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of
sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted
to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios,
as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models,
focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including
imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing
reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key
challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of

four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the

not restricted to large neural models. Additionally, to mitigate these

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The privacy concerns associated with the use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
have grown recently with the development of LLMs such as ChatGPT. Differential
Privacy (DP) techniques are explored in existing work to mitigate their privacy
risks at the cost of generalization degradation. Our paper reveals that the
flatness of DP-trained models' loss landscape plays an essential role in the
trade-off between their privacy and generalization. We further propose a
holistic framework to enforce appropriate weight flatness, which substantially
improves model generalization with competitive privacy preservation. It
innovates from three coarse-to-grained levels, including perturbation-aware
min-max optimization on model weights within a layer, flatness-guided sparse
prefix-tuning on weights across layers, and weight knowledge distillation
between DP \& non-DP weights copies. Comprehensive experiments of both
black-box and white-box scenarios are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposal in enhancing generalization and maintaining DP
characteristics. For instance, on text classification dataset QNLI, DP-Flat
achieves similar performance with non-private full fine-tuning but with DP
guarantee under privacy budget $\epsilon=3$, and even better performance given
higher privacy budgets. Codes are provided in the supplement.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Kinshuk Jerath, Klaus M. Miller</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> In response to privacy concerns about collecting and using personal data, the
online advertising industry has been developing privacy-enhancing technologies
(PETs), e.g., under Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative. In this research, we
use the dual-privacy framework, which postulates that consumers have intrinsic
and instrumental preferences for privacy, to understand consumers' perceived
privacy violations (PPVs) for current and proposed online advertising
practices. The key idea is that different practices differ in whether
individual data leaves the consumer's machine or not and in how they track and
target consumers; these affect, respectively, the intrinsic and instrumental
components of privacy preferences differently, leading to different PPVs for
different practices. We conducted online studies focused on consumers in the
United States to elicit PPVs for various advertising practices. Our findings
confirm the intuition that tracking and targeting consumers under the industry
status quo of behavioral targeting leads to high PPV. New technologies or
proposals that ensure that data are kept on the consumer's machine lower PPV
relative to behavioral targeting but, importantly, this decrease is small.
Furthermore, group-level targeting does not differ significantly from
individual-level targeting in reducing PPV. Under contextual targeting, where
there is no tracking, PPV is significantly reduced. Interestingly, with respect
to PPV, consumers are indifferent between seeing untargeted ads and no ads when
they are not being tracked. We find that consumer perceptions of privacy
violations under different tracking and targeting practices may differ from
what technical definitions suggest. Therefore, rather than relying solely on
technical perspectives, a consumer-centric approach to privacy is needed, based
on, for instance, the dual-privacy framework.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Mueller-Tribbensee, Klaus M. Miller, Bernd Skiera</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Prestigious news publishers, and more recently, Meta, have begun to request
that users pay for privacy. Specifically, users receive a notification banner,
referred to as a pay-or-tracking wall, that requires them to (i) pay money to
avoid being tracked or (ii) consent to being tracked. These walls have invited
concerns that privacy might become a luxury. However, little is known about
pay-or-tracking walls, which prevents a meaningful discussion about their
appropriateness. This paper conducts several empirical studies and finds that
top EU publishers use pay-or-tracking walls. Their implementations involve
various approaches, including bundling the pay option with advertising-free
access or additional content. The price for not being tracked exceeds the
advertising revenue that publishers generate from a user who consents to being
tracked. Notably, publishers' traffic does not decline when implementing a
pay-or-tracking wall and most users consent to being tracked; only a few users
pay. In short, pay-or-tracking walls seem to provide the means for expanding
the practice of tracking. Publishers profit from pay-or-tracking walls and may
observe a revenue increase of 16.4% due to tracking more users than under a
cookie consent banner.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to enhance recommendation accuracy in
a target domain with sparse data by leveraging rich information in a source
domain, thereby addressing the data-sparsity problem. Some existing CDR methods
highlight the advantages of extracting domain-common and domain-specific
features to learn comprehensive user and item representations. However, these
methods can't effectively disentangle these components as they often rely on
simple user-item historical interaction information (such as ratings, clicks,
and browsing), neglecting the rich multi-modal features. Additionally, they
don't protect user-sensitive data from potential leakage during knowledge
transfer between domains. To address these challenges, we propose a
Privacy-Preserving Framework with Multi-Modal Data for Cross-Domain
Recommendation, called P2M2-CDR. Specifically, we first design a multi-modal
disentangled encoder that utilizes multi-modal information to disentangle more
informative domain-common and domain-specific embeddings. Furthermore, we
introduce a privacy-preserving decoder to mitigate user privacy leakage during
knowledge transfer. Local differential privacy (LDP) is utilized to obfuscate
the disentangled embeddings before inter-domain exchange, thereby enhancing
privacy protection. To ensure both consistency and differentiation among these
obfuscated disentangled embeddings, we incorporate contrastive learning-based
domain-inter and domain-intra losses. Extensive Experiments conducted on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that P2M2-CDR outperforms other
state-of-the-art single-domain and cross-domain baselines.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine Learning (ML), addresses a multitude of complex issues in multiple
disciplines, including social sciences, finance, and medical research. ML
models require substantial computing power and are only as powerful as the data
utilized. Due to high computational cost of ML methods, data scientists
frequently use Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) to outsource computation
to external servers. However, when working with private information, like
financial data or health records, outsourcing the computation might result in
privacy issues. Recent advances in Privacy-Preserving Techniques (PPTs) have
enabled ML training and inference over protected data through the use of
Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). However, these techniques are still
at a preliminary stage and their application in real-world situations is
demanding. In order to comprehend discrepancy between theoretical research
suggestions and actual applications, this work examines the past and present of
PPML, focusing on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-party
Computation (SMPC) applied to ML. This work primarily focuses on the ML model's
training phase, where maintaining user data privacy is of utmost importance. We
provide a solid theoretical background that eases the understanding of current
approaches and their limitations. In addition, we present a SoK of the most
recent PPML frameworks for model training and provide a comprehensive
comparison in terms of the unique properties and performances on standard
benchmarks. Also, we reproduce the results for some of the papers and examine
at what level existing works in the field provide support for open science. We
believe our work serves as a valuable contribution by raising awareness about
the current gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications in
PPML, specifically regarding open-source availability, reproducibility, and
usability.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We introduce a new notion of neighboring databases for coverage problems such
as Max Cover and Set Cover under differential privacy. In contrast to the
standard privacy notion for these problems, which is analogous to node-privacy
in graphs, our new definition gives a more fine-grained privacy guarantee,
which is analogous to edge-privacy. We illustrate several scenarios of Set
Cover and Max Cover where our privacy notion is desired one for the
application.
  Our main result is an $\epsilon$-edge differentially private algorithm for
Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\eta,\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon))$-approximation
with high probability. Furthermore, we show that this result is nearly tight:
we give a lower bound show that an additive error of $\Omega(k/\epsilon)$ is
necessary under edge-differential privacy. Via group privacy properties, this
implies a new algorithm for $\epsilon$-node differentially private Max Cover
which obtains an $(1-1/e-\eta,\tilde{O}(fk/\epsilon))$-approximation, where $f$
is the maximum degree of an element in the set system. When $f\ll k$, this
improves over the best known algorithm for Max Cover under pure (node)
differential privacy, which obtains an
$(1-1/e,\tilde{O}(k^2/\epsilon))$-approximation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Maintaining the privacy of power system data is essential for protecting
sensitive information and ensuring the operation security of critical
infrastructure. Therefore, the adoption of centralized deep learning (DL)
transient stability assessment (TSA) frameworks can introduce risks to electric
utilities. This is because these frameworks make utility data susceptible to
cyber threats and communication issues when transmitting data to a central
server for training a single TSA model. Additionally, the centralized approach
demands significant computational resources, which may not always be readily
available. In light of these challenges, this paper introduces a federated
DL-based TSA framework designed to identify the operating states of the power
system. Instead of local utilities transmitting their data to a central server
for centralized model training, they independently train their own TSA models
using their respective datasets. Subsequently, the parameters of each local TSA

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this paper, we examine the role of stochastic quantizers for privacy
preservation. We first employ a static stochastic quantizer and investigate its
corresponding privacy-preserving properties. Specifically, we demonstrate that
a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential
privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by
quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two
analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance,
determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use
quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two
goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same
time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer.
Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance
privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control
performance. We further handle the unstable case by additionally applying input
Gaussian noise.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Google Bard, Claude, and Llama 2
have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics.
However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For
instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters and inference on these
models also demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural
solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries. However, existing
caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM
queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates.
  This paper introduces MeanCache, a semantic cache for LLMs that identifies
semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache,
the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a
local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service
provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning
(FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model in a distributed manner
across numerous users without violating privacy. By placing a local cache in
each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and
enhances model performance, resulting in lower cache false hit rates. Our
experiments, benchmarked against the GPTCache, reveal that MeanCache attains an
approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during
semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions. Furthermore, MeanCache reduces the
storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss
decisions by 11%, while still surpassing GPTCache.</p>

  <img alt="Category Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Programming Languages-D91E36">
  <p><b>Published on:</b> 2024-03-04T19:07:42Z</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Greenman, Alan Jeffrey, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Mitesh Shah</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Context: Roblox Studio lets millions of creators build interactive
experiences by programming in a variant of Lua called Luau. The creators form a
broad group, ranging from novices writing their first script to professional
developers; thus, Luau must support a wide audience. As part of its efforts to
support all kinds of programmers, Luau includes an optional, gradual type
system and goes to great lengths to minimize false positive errors.
  Inquiry: Since Luau is currently being used by many creators, we want to
collect data to improve the language and, in particular, the type system. The
standard way to collect data is to deploy client-side telemetry; however, we
cannot scrape personal data or proprietary information, which means we cannot
collect source code fragments, error messages, or even filepaths. The research
questions are thus about how to conduct telemetry that is not invasive and
obtain insights from it about type errors.
  Approach: We designed and implemented a pseudonymized, randomly-sampling
telemetry system for Luau. Telemetry records include a timestamp, a session id,
a reason for sending, and a numeric summary of the most recent type analyses.
This information lets us study type errors over time without revealing private
data. We deployed the system in Roblox Studio during Spring 2023 and collected
over 1.5 million telemetry records from over 340,000 sessions.
  Knowledge: We present several findings about Luau, all of which suggest that
telemetry is an effective way to study type error pragmatics. One of the
less-surprising findings is that opt-in gradual types are unpopular: there is
an 100x gap between the number of untyped Luau sessions and the number of typed
ones. One surprise is that the strict mode for type analysis is overly
conservative about interactions with data assets. A reassuring finding is that
type analysis rarely hits its internal limits on problem size.
  Grounding: Our findings are supported by a dataset of over 1.5 million
telemetry records. The data and scripts for analyzing it are available in an
artifact.
  Importance: Beyond the immediate benefits to Luau, our findings about types
and type errors have implications for adoption and ergonomics in other gradual
languages such as TypeScript, Elixir, and Typed Racket. Our telemetry design is
of broad interest, as it reports on type errors without revealing sensitive
information.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this paper, we present a framework based on differential privacy (DP) for
querying electric power measurements to detect system anomalies or bad data
caused by false data injections (FDIs). Our DP approach conceals consumption
and system matrix data, while simultaneously enabling an untrusted third party
to test hypotheses of anomalies, such as an FDI attack, by releasing a
randomized sufficient statistic for hypothesis-testing. We consider a
measurement model corrupted by Gaussian noise and a sparse noise vector
representing the attack, and we observe that the optimal test statistic is a
chi-square random variable. To detect possible attacks, we propose a novel DP
chi-square noise mechanism that ensures the test does not reveal private
information about power injections or the system matrix. The proposed framework
provides a robust solution for detecting FDIs while preserving the privacy of
sensitive power system data.</p>

consistent growth of privacy-relevant reviews, and explore topics that are
trending (such as Data Deletion and Data Theft), as well as those on the
decline (such as privacy-relevant reviews on sensitive permissions). We find
that although privacy reviews come from more than 200 countries, 33 countries
provide 90% of privacy reviews. We conduct a comparison across countries by
examining the distribution of privacy topics a country's users write about, and
find that geographic proximity is not a reliable indicator that nearby
countries have similar privacy perspectives. We uncover some countries with
unique patterns and explore those herein. Surprisingly, we uncover that it is
not uncommon for reviews that discuss privacy to be positive (32%); many users
express pleasure about privacy features within apps or privacy-focused apps. We
also uncover some unexpected behaviors, such as the use of reviews to deliver

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning (ML) is vulnerable to inference (e.g., membership inference,
property inference, and data reconstruction) attacks that aim to infer the
private information of training data or dataset. Existing defenses are only
designed for one specific type of attack and sacrifice significant utility or
are soon broken by adaptive attacks. We address these limitations by proposing
an information-theoretic defense framework, called Inf2Guard, against the three
major types of inference attacks. Our framework, inspired by the success of
representation learning, posits that learning shared representations not only
saves time/costs but also benefits numerous downstream tasks. Generally,
Inf2Guard involves two mutual information objectives, for privacy protection
and utility preservation, respectively. Inf2Guard exhibits many merits: it
facilitates the design of customized objectives against the specific inference
attack; it provides a general defense framework which can treat certain
existing defenses as special cases; and importantly, it aids in deriving
theoretical results, e.g., inherent utility-privacy tradeoff and guaranteed
privacy leakage. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness of Inf2Guard
for learning privacy-preserving representations against inference attacks and
demonstrate the superiority over the baselines.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Injecting heavy-tailed noise to the iterates of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) has received increasing attention over the past few years. While various
theoretical properties of the resulting algorithm have been analyzed mainly
from learning theory and optimization perspectives, their privacy preservation
properties have not yet been established. Aiming to bridge this gap, we provide
differential privacy (DP) guarantees for noisy SGD, when the injected noise
follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution, which includes a spectrum of
heavy-tailed distributions (with infinite variance) as well as the Gaussian
distribution. Considering the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP framework, we show that
SGD with heavy-tailed perturbations achieves $(0, \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/n))$-DP
for a broad class of loss functions which can be non-convex, where $n$ is the
number of data points. As a remarkable byproduct, contrary to prior work that
necessitates bounded sensitivity for the gradients or clipping the iterates,
our theory reveals that under mild assumptions, such a projection step is not
actually necessary. We illustrate that the heavy-tailed noising mechanism
achieves similar DP guarantees compared to the Gaussian case, which suggests
that it can be a viable alternative to its light-tailed counterparts.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> (p,q)-clique enumeration on a bipartite graph is critical for calculating
clustering coefficient and detecting densest subgraph. It is necessary to carry
out subgraph enumeration while protecting users' privacy from any potential
attacker as the count of subgraph may contain sensitive information. Most
recent studies focus on the privacy protection algorithms based on edge LDP
(Local Differential Privacy). However, these algorithms suffer a large
estimation error due to the great amount of required noise. In this paper, we
propose a novel idea of k-stars LDP and a novel k-stars LDP algorithm for (p,
q)-clique enumeration with a small estimation error, where a k-stars is a
star-shaped graph with k nodes connecting to one node. The effectiveness of
edge LDP relies on its capacity to obfuscate the existence of an edge between
the user and his one-hop neighbors. This is based on the premise that a user
should be aware of the existence of his one-hop neighbors. Similarly, we can
apply this premise to k-stars as well, where an edge is a specific genre of
1-stars. Based on this fact, we first propose the k-stars neighboring list to
enable our algorithm to obfuscate the existence of k-stars with Warner' s RR.
Then, we propose the absolute value correction technique and the k-stars
sampling technique to further reduce the estimation error. Finally, with the
two-round user-collector interaction mechanism, we propose our k-stars LDP
algorithm to count the number of (p, q)-clique while successfully protecting
users' privacy. Both the theoretical analysis and experiments have showed the
superiority of our algorithm over the algorithms based on edge LDP.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Accurate load forecasting is crucial for energy management, infrastructure
planning, and demand-supply balancing. Smart meter data availability has led to
the demand for sensor-based load forecasting. Conventional ML allows training a
single global model using data from multiple smart meters requiring data
transfer to a central server, raising concerns for network requirements,
privacy, and security. We propose a split learning-based framework for load
forecasting to alleviate this issue. We split a deep neural network model into
two parts, one for each Grid Station (GS) responsible for an entire
neighbourhood's smart meters and the other for the Service Provider (SP).
Instead of sharing their data, client smart meters use their respective GSs'
model split for forward pass and only share their activations with the GS.
Under this framework, each GS is responsible for training a personalized model
split for their respective neighbourhoods, whereas the SP can train a single
global or personalized model for each GS. Experiments show that the proposed
models match or exceed a centrally trained model's performance and generalize
well. Privacy is analyzed by assessing information leakage between data and
shared activations of the GS model split. Additionally, differential privacy
enhances local data privacy while examining its impact on performance. A
transformer model is used as our base learner.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper studies the distributed least-squares optimization problem with
differential privacy requirement of local cost functions, for which two
differentially private distributed solvers are proposed. The first is
established on the distributed gradient tracking algorithm, by appropriately
perturbing the initial values and parameters that contain the privacy-sensitive
data with Gaussian and truncated Laplacian noises, respectively. Rigorous
proofs are established to show the achievable trade-off between the
({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential privacy and the computation accuracy. The
second solver is established on the combination of the distributed shuffling
mechanism and the average consensus algorithm, which enables each agent to
obtain a noisy version of parameters characterizing the global gradient. As a
result, the least-squares optimization problem can be eventually solved by each
agent locally in such a way that any given ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential
privacy requirement can be preserved while the solution may be computed with
the accuracy independent of the network size, which makes the latter more
suitable for large-scale distributed least-squares problems. Numerical
simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of both solvers.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recognizing speaking in humans is a central task towards understanding social
interactions. Ideally, speaking would be detected from individual voice
recordings, as done previously for meeting scenarios. However, individual voice
recordings are hard to obtain in the wild, especially in crowded mingling
scenarios due to cost, logistics, and privacy concerns. As an alternative,
machine learning models trained on video and wearable sensor data make it
possible to recognize speech by detecting its related gestures in an
unobtrusive, privacy-preserving way. These models themselves should ideally be
trained using labels obtained from the speech signal. However, existing
mingling datasets do not contain high quality audio recordings. Instead,
speaking status annotations have often been inferred by human annotators from
video, without validation of this approach against audio-based ground truth. In
this paper we revisit no-audio speaking status estimation by presenting the
first publicly available multimodal dataset with high-quality individual speech
recordings of 33 subjects in a professional networking event. We present three
baselines for no-audio speaking status segmentation: a) from video, b) from
body acceleration (chest-worn accelerometer), c) from body pose tracks. In all
cases we predict a 20Hz binary speaking status signal extracted from the audio,
a time resolution not available in previous datasets. In addition to providing
the signals and ground truth necessary to evaluate a wide range of speaking
status detection methods, the availability of audio in REWIND makes it suitable
for cross-modality studies not feasible with previous mingling datasets.
Finally, our flexible data consent setup creates new challenges for multimodal
systems under missing modalities.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The high cost of model training makes it increasingly desirable to develop
techniques for unlearning. These techniques seek to remove the influence of a
training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively,
once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should
no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the
model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as
membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership
Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their
``U-MIA'' counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into
``population U-MIAs'', where the same attacker is instantiated for all
examples, and ``per-example U-MIAs'', where a dedicated attacker is
instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the
attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is
significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs
in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by
existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our
investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different
examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to
a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to
unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find
that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a
consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of
equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the
different rates at which examples are unlearned. We demonstrate that naive
attempts at tailoring unlearning stopping criteria to different examples fail
to alleviate these issues.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We propose an efficient solver for the privacy funnel (PF) method, leveraging
its difference-of-convex (DC) structure. The proposed DC separation results in
a closed-form update equation, which allows straightforward application to both
known and unknown distribution settings. For known distribution case, we prove
the convergence (local stationary points) of the proposed non-greedy solver,
and empirically show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in
characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off. The insights of our DC approach
apply to unknown distribution settings where labeled empirical samples are
available instead. Leveraging the insights, our alternating minimization solver
satisfies the fundamental Markov relation of PF in contrast to previous
variational inference-based solvers. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed
solver with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results show that under a
comparable reconstruction quality, an adversary suffers from higher prediction
error from clustering our compressed codes than that with the compared methods.
Most importantly, our solver is independent to private information in inference
phase contrary to the baselines.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Noisy gradient descent and its variants are the predominant algorithms for
differentially private machine learning. It is a fundamental question to
quantify their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in
the foundational setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous
analyses by establishing (and refining) the "privacy amplification by
iteration" phenomenon in the unifying framework of $f$-differential
privacy--which tightly captures all aspects of the privacy loss and immediately
implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions of differential privacy,
e.g., $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and Renyi DP. Our key technical insight is the
construction of shifted interpolated processes that unravel the popular
shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based
relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first exact privacy analysis in
the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend
to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained,
full/cyclic/stochastic batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate
corollary, we recover the $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism
for strongly convex optimization in Gopi et al. (2022), and moreover extend
this result to more general settings.</p>
