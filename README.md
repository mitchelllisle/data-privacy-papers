    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, large language models
(LLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing. These
models are trained on large amounts of data to demonstrate powerful language
understanding and generation capabilities for various applications, from
machine translation and chatbots to agents. However, LLMs have exposed a
variety of privacy and security issues during their life cycle, which have
become the focus of academic and industrial attention. Moreover, these risks
LLMs face are pretty different from previous traditional language models. Since
current surveys lack a clear taxonomy of unique threat models based on diverse
scenarios, we highlight unique privacy and security issues based on five
scenarios: pre-training, fine-tuning, RAG system, deploying, and LLM-based
agent. Concerning the characteristics of each risk, this survey provides
potential threats and countermeasures. The research on attack and defense
situations LLMs face can provide feasible research directions, making more
areas reap LLMs' benefits.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Graph neural networks based on message-passing mechanisms have achieved
advanced results in graph classification tasks. However, their generalization
performance degrades when noisy labels are present in the training data. Most
existing noisy labeling approaches focus on the visual domain or graph node
classification tasks and analyze the impact of noisy labels only from a utility
perspective. Unlike existing work, in this paper, we measure the effects of
noise labels on graph classification from data privacy and model utility
perspectives. We find that noise labels degrade the model's generalization
performance and enhance the ability of membership inference attacks on graph
data privacy. To this end, we propose the robust graph neural network approach
with noisy labeled graph classification. Specifically, we first accurately
filter the noisy samples by high-confidence samples and the first feature
principal component vector of each class. Then, the robust principal component
vectors and the model output under data augmentation are utilized to achieve
noise label correction guided by dual spatial information. Finally, supervised
graph contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the embedding quality of
the model and protect the privacy of the training graph data. The utility and
privacy of the proposed method are validated by comparing twelve different
methods on eight real graph classification datasets. Compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, the RGLC method achieves at most and at least 7.8%
and 0.8% performance gain at 30% noisy labeling rate, respectively, and reduces
the accuracy of privacy attacks to below 60%.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Information density and its exponential form, known as lift, play a central
role in information privacy leakage measures. $\alpha$-lift is the power-mean
of lift, which is tunable between the worst-case measure max-lift
($\alpha=\infty$) and more relaxed versions ($\alpha<\infty$). This paper
investigates the optimization problem of the privacy-utility tradeoff where
$\alpha$-lift and mutual information are privacy and utility measures,
respectively. Due to the nonlinear nature of $\alpha$-lift for $\alpha<\infty$,
finding the optimal solution is challenging. Therefore, we propose a heuristic
algorithm to estimate the optimal utility for each value of $\alpha$, inspired
by the optimal solution for $\alpha=\infty$. In proposing the algorithm, we
prove and use the convexity of $\alpha$-lift with respect to the lift.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper studies federated learning for nonparametric regression in the
context of distributed samples across different servers, each adhering to
distinct differential privacy constraints. The setting we consider is
heterogeneous, encompassing both varying sample sizes and differential privacy
constraints across servers. Within this framework, both global and pointwise
estimation are considered, and optimal rates of convergence over the Besov
spaces are established.
  Distributed privacy-preserving estimators are proposed and their risk
properties are investigated. Matching minimax lower bounds, up to a logarithmic
factor, are established for both global and pointwise estimation. Together,
these findings shed light on the tradeoff between statistical accuracy and
privacy preservation. In particular, we characterize the compromise not only in
terms of the privacy budget but also concerning the loss incurred by
distributing data within the privacy framework as a whole. This insight
captures the folklore wisdom that it is easier to retain privacy in larger
samples, and explores the differences between pointwise and global estimation
under distributed privacy constraints.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning has attracted significant recent attention due to its
applicability across a wide range of settings where data is collected and
analyzed across disparate locations. In this paper, we study federated
nonparametric goodness-of-fit testing in the white-noise-with-drift model under
distributed differential privacy (DP) constraints.
  We first establish matching lower and upper bounds, up to a logarithmic
factor, on the minimax separation rate. This optimal rate serves as a benchmark
for the difficulty of the testing problem, factoring in model characteristics
such as the number of observations, noise level, and regularity of the signal
class, along with the strictness of the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP requirement. The
results demonstrate interesting and novel phase transition phenomena.
Furthermore, the results reveal an interesting phenomenon that distributed
one-shot protocols with access to shared randomness outperform those without
access to shared randomness. We also construct a data-driven testing procedure
that possesses the ability to adapt to an unknown regularity parameter over a
large collection of function classes with minimal additional cost, all while
maintaining adherence to the same set of DP constraints.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Children's and adolescents' online data privacy are regulated by laws such as
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Online services that are directed towards general
audiences (i.e., including children, adolescents, and adults) must comply with
these laws. In this paper, first, we present DiffAudit, a platform-agnostic
privacy auditing methodology for general audience services. DiffAudit performs
differential analysis of network traffic data flows to compare data processing
practices (i) between child, adolescent, and adult users and (ii) before and
after consent is given and user age is disclosed. We also present a data type
classification method that utilizes GPT-4 and our data type ontology based on
COPPA and CCPA, allowing us to identify considerably more data types than prior
work. Second, we apply DiffAudit to a set of popular general audience mobile
and web services and observe a rich set of behaviors extracted from over 440K
outgoing requests, containing 3,968 unique data types we extracted and
classified. We reveal problematic data processing practices prior to consent
and age disclosure, lack of differentiation between age-specific data flows,
inconsistent privacy policy disclosures, and sharing of linkable data with
third parties, including advertising and tracking services.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The explosive growth of machine learning has made it a critical
infrastructure in the era of artificial intelligence. The extensive use of data
poses a significant threat to individual privacy. Various countries have
implemented corresponding laws, such as GDPR, to protect individuals' data
privacy and the right to be forgotten. This has made machine unlearning a
research hotspot in the field of privacy protection in recent years, with the
aim of efficiently removing the contribution and impact of individual data from
trained models. The research in academia on machine unlearning has continuously
enriched its theoretical foundation, and many methods have been proposed,
targeting different data removal requests in various application scenarios.
However, recently researchers have found potential privacy leakages of various
of machine unlearning approaches, making the privacy preservation on machine
unlearning area a critical topic. This paper provides an overview and analysis
of the existing research on machine unlearning, aiming to present the current
vulnerabilities of machine unlearning approaches. We analyze privacy risks in
various aspects, including definitions, implementation methods, and real-world
applications. Compared to existing reviews, we analyze the new challenges posed
by the latest malicious attack techniques on machine unlearning from the
perspective of privacy threats. We hope that this survey can provide an initial

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This study investigates the optimal selection of parameters for collaborative
clustering while ensuring data privacy. We focus on key clustering algorithms
within a collaborative framework, where multiple data owners combine their
data. A semi-trusted server assists in recommending the most suitable
clustering algorithm and its parameters. Our findings indicate that the privacy
parameter ($\epsilon$) minimally impacts the server's recommendations, but an
increase in $\epsilon$ raises the risk of membership inference attacks, where
sensitive information might be inferred. To mitigate these risks, we implement
differential privacy techniques, particularly the Randomized Response
mechanism, to add noise and protect data privacy. Our approach demonstrates
that high-quality clustering can be achieved while maintaining data
confidentiality, as evidenced by metrics such as the Adjusted Rand Index and
Silhouette Score. This study contributes to privacy-aware data sharing, optimal
algorithm and parameter selection, and effective communication between data
owners and the server.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart speakers can collect
sensitive user data, necessitating the need for users to manage their privacy
preferences. However, configuring these preferences presents users with
multiple challenges. Existing privacy controls often lack transparency, are
hard to understand, and do not provide meaningful choices. On top of that,
users struggle to locate privacy settings due to multiple menus or confusing
labeling, which discourages them from using these controls. We introduce
PriviFy (Privacy Simplify-er), a novel and user-friendly tangible interface
that can simplify the configuration of smart devices privacy settings. PriviFy
is designed to propose an enhancement to existing hardware by integrating
additional features that improve privacy management. We envision that positive
feedback and user experiences from our study will inspire consumer product
developers and smart device manufacturers to incorporate the useful design
elements we have identified. Using fidelity prototyping, we iteratively
designed PriviFy prototype with 20 participants to include interactive features
such as knobs, buttons, lights, and notifications that allow users to configure
their data privacy preferences and receive confirmation of their choices. We
further evaluated PriviFy high-fidelity prototype with 20 more participants.
Our results show that PriviFy helps simplify the complexity of privacy
preferences configuration with a significant usability score at p < .05 (P =
0.000000017, t = -8.8639). PriviFy successfully met users privacy needs and
enabled them to regain control over their data. We conclude by recommending the

    <p><b>Summary:</b> People are increasingly bringing Internet of Things (IoT) devices into their
homes without understanding how their data is gathered, processed, and used. We
describe PrivacyCube, a novel data physicalization designed to increase privacy
awareness within smart home environments. PrivacyCube visualizes IoT data
consumption by displaying privacy-related notices. PrivacyCube aims to assist
smart home occupants to (i) understand their data privacy better and (ii) have
conversations around data management practices of IoT devices used within their
homes. Using PrivacyCube, households can learn and make informed privacy
decisions collectively. To evaluate PrivacyCube, we used multiple research
methods throughout the different stages of design. We first conducted a focus
group study in two stages with six participants to compare PrivacyCube to text
and state-of-the-art privacy policies. We then deployed PrivacyCube in a
14-day-long field study with eight households. Our results show that
PrivacyCube helps home occupants comprehend IoT privacy better with
significantly increased privacy awareness at p < .05 (p=0.00041, t= -5.57).
Participants preferred PrivacyCube over text privacy policies because it was
comprehensive and easier to use. PrivacyCube and Privacy Label, a
state-of-the-art approach, both received positive reviews from participants,
with PrivacyCube being preferred for its interactivity and ability to encourage
conversations. PrivacyCube was also considered by home occupants as a piece of

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We present a practical method to audit the differential privacy (DP)
guarantees of a machine learning model using a small hold-out dataset that is
not exposed to the model during the training. Having a score function such as
the loss function employed during the training, our method estimates the total
variation (TV) distance between scores obtained with a subset of the training
data and the hold-out dataset. With some meta information about the underlying
DP training algorithm, these TV distance values can be converted to
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-guarantees for any $\delta$. We show that these score
distributions asymptotically give lower bounds for the DP guarantees of the
underlying training algorithm, however, we perform a one-shot estimation for
practicality reasons. We specify conditions that lead to lower bounds for the
DP guarantees with high probability. To estimate the TV distance between the
score distributions, we use a simple density estimation method based on
histograms. We show that the TV distance gives a very close to optimally robust
estimator and has an error rate $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/3})$, where $k$ is the total
number of samples. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the
effectiveness of our approach and show improvements over baseline methods for
black-box auditing.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated recommender systems have been crucially enhanced through data
sharing and continuous model updates, attributed to the pervasive connectivity
and distributed computing capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Given the sensitivity of IoT data, transparent data processing in data sharing
and model updates is paramount. However, existing methods fall short in tracing
the flow of shared data and the evolution of model updates. Consequently, data
sharing is vulnerable to exploitation by malicious entities, raising
significant data privacy concerns, while excluding data sharing will result in
sub-optimal recommendations. To mitigate these concerns, we present LIBERATE, a
privacy-traceable federated recommender system. We design a blockchain-based
traceability mechanism, ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model
updates. We further enhance privacy protection by incorporating local
differential privacy in user-server communication. Extensive evaluations with
the real-world dataset corroborate LIBERATE's capabilities in ensuring data
privacy during data sharing and model update while maintaining efficiency and
performance. Results underscore blockchain-based traceability mechanism as a
promising solution for privacy-preserving in federated recommender systems.</p>

contrastive explanations with differential privacy in clustering methods. For
several basic clustering problems, including $k$-median and $k$-means, we give
efficient differential private contrastive explanations that achieve
essentially the same explanations as those that non-private clustering
explanations can obtain. We define contrastive explanations as the utility
difference between the original clustering utility and utility from clustering
with a specifically fixed centroid. In each contrastive scenario, we designate
a specific data point as the fixed centroid position, enabling us to measure
the impact of this constraint on clustering utility under differential privacy.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show our method's effectiveness
in providing meaningful explanations without significantly compromising data
privacy or clustering utility. This underscores our contribution to
privacy-aware machine learning, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving a
balance between privacy and utility in the explanation of clustering tasks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy is a framework for protecting the identity of individual

of differential privacy called tangent differential privacy. Compared with the
usual differential privacy that is defined uniformly across data distributions,
tangent differential privacy is tailored towards a specific data distribution
of interest. It also allows for general distribution distances such as total

we show that entropic regularization guarantees tangent differential privacy

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Lensless cameras, innovatively replacing traditional lenses for ultra-thin,
flat optics, encode light directly onto sensors, producing images that are not
immediately recognizable. This compact, lightweight, and cost-effective imaging
solution offers inherent privacy advantages, making it attractive for
privacy-sensitive applications like face verification. Typical lensless face
verification adopts a two-stage process of reconstruction followed by
verification, incurring privacy risks from reconstructed faces and high
computational costs. This paper presents an end-to-end optimization approach
for privacy-preserving face verification directly on encoded lensless captures,
ensuring that the entire software pipeline remains encoded with no visible
faces as intermediate results. To achieve this, we propose several techniques
to address unique challenges from the lensless setup which precludes
traditional face detection and alignment. Specifically, we propose a face
center alignment scheme, an augmentation curriculum to build robustness against
variations, and a knowledge distillation method to smooth optimization and
enhance performance. Evaluations under both simulation and real environment
demonstrate our method outperforms two-stage lensless verification while
enhancing privacy and efficiency. Project website:

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy with gradual expiration models the setting where data
items arrive in a stream and at a given time $t$ the privacy loss guaranteed
for a data item seen at time $(t-d)$ is $\epsilon g(d)$, where $g$ is a
monotonically non-decreasing function. We study the fundamental
$\textit{continual (binary) counting}$ problem where each data item consists of
a bit, and the algorithm needs to output at each time step the sum of all the
bits streamed so far. For a stream of length $T$ and privacy $\textit{without}$
expiration continual counting is possible with maximum (over all time steps)
additive error $O(\log^2(T)/\varepsilon)$ and the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(\log(T)/\varepsilon)$; closing this gap is a challenging open problem.
  We show that the situation is very different for privacy with gradual
expiration by giving upper and lower bounds for a large set of expiration
functions $g$. Specifically, our algorithm achieves an additive error of $
O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$ for a large set of privacy expiration functions. We also
give a lower bound that shows that if $C$ is the additive error of any
$\epsilon$-DP algorithm for this problem, then the product of $C$ and the
privacy expiration function after $2C$ steps must be
$\Omega(\log(T)/\epsilon)$. Our algorithm matches this lower bound as its
additive error is $O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$, even when $g(2C) = O(1)$.
  Our empirical evaluation shows that we achieve a slowly growing privacy loss
with significantly smaller empirical privacy loss for large values of $d$ than
a natural baseline algorithm.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper identifies that a group of state-of-the-art
locally-differentially-private (LDP) algorithms for frequency estimation are
equivalent to the private Count-Mean Sketch (CMS) algorithm with different
parameters. Therefore, we revisit the private CMS, correct errors in the
original CMS paper regarding expectation and variance, modify the CMS
implementation to eliminate existing bias, and explore optimized parameters for
CMS to achieve optimality in reducing the worst-case mean squared error (MSE),
$l_1$ loss, and $l_2$ loss. Additionally, we prove that pairwise-independent
hashing is sufficient for CMS, reducing its communication cost to the logarithm
of the cardinality of all possible values (i.e., a dictionary). As a result,
the aforementioned optimized CMS is proven theoretically and empirically to be
the only algorithm optimized for reducing the worst-case MSE, $l_1$ loss, and
$l_2$ loss when dealing with a very large dictionary. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that randomness is necessary to ensure the correctness of CMS, and
the communication cost of CMS, though low, is unavoidable despite the
randomness being public or private.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We consider the problem of privately estimating the mean of vectors
distributed across different nodes of an unreliable wireless network, where
communications between nodes can fail intermittently. We adopt a
semi-decentralized setup, wherein to mitigate the impact of intermittently
connected links, nodes can collaborate with their neighbors to compute a local
consensus, which they relay to a central server. In such a setting, the
communications between any pair of nodes must ensure that the privacy of the
nodes is rigorously maintained to prevent unauthorized information leakage. We
study the tradeoff between collaborative relaying and privacy leakage due to
the data sharing among nodes and, subsequently, propose PriCER: Private
Collaborative Estimation via Relaying -- a differentially private collaborative
algorithm for mean estimation to optimize this tradeoff. The privacy guarantees
of PriCER arise (i) implicitly, by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of the
flaky network connections, and (ii) explicitly, by adding Gaussian
perturbations to the estimates exchanged by the nodes. Local and central
privacy guarantees are provided against eavesdroppers who can observe different
signals, such as the communications amongst nodes during local consensus and
(possibly multiple) transmissions from the relays to the central server. We
substantiate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations. Our
implementation is available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Increasing concerns about privacy leakage issues in academia and industry
arise when employing NLP models from third-party providers to process sensitive
texts. To protect privacy before sending sensitive data to those models, we
suggest sanitizing sensitive text using two common strategies used by humans:
i) deleting sensitive expressions, and ii) obscuring sensitive details by
abstracting them. To explore the issues and develop a tool for text rewriting,
we curate the first corpus, coined NAP^2, through both crowdsourcing and the
use of large language models (LLMs). Compared to the prior works based on
differential privacy, which lead to a sharp drop in information utility and
unnatural texts, the human-inspired approaches result in more natural rewrites
and offer an improved balance between privacy protection and data utility, as
demonstrated by our extensive experiments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Data-driven landscape across finance, government, and healthcare, the
continuous generation of information demands robust solutions for secure
storage, efficient dissemination, and fine-grained access control. Blockchain
technology emerges as a significant tool, offering decentralized storage while
upholding the tenets of data security and accessibility. However, on-chain and
off-chain strategies are still confronted with issues such as untrusted
off-chain data storage, absence of data ownership, limited access control
policy for clients, and a deficiency in data privacy and auditability. To solve
these challenges, we propose a permissioned blockchain-based privacy-preserving
fine-grained access control on-chain and off-chain system, namely FACOS. We
applied three fine-grained access control solutions and comprehensively
analyzed them in different aspects, which provides an intuitive perspective for
system designers and clients to choose the appropriate access control method
for their systems. Compared to similar work that only stores encrypted data in
centralized or non-fault-tolerant IPFS systems, we enhanced off-chain data
storage security and robustness by utilizing a highly efficient and secure
asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol in the off-chain
environment. As each of the clients needs to be verified and authorized before
accessing the data, we involved the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-based
solution to verify the credentials of clients. Additionally, our evaluation
results demonstrated that our system offers better scalability and practicality

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this article, we present Ariadne, a privacy-preserving communication
network layer protocol that uses a source routing approach to avoid relying on
trusted third parties. In Ariadne, a source node willing to send anonymized
network traffic to a destination uses a path consisting in nodes with which it
has pre-shared symmetric keys. Temporary keys derived from those pre-shared
keys to protect communication privacy using onion routing techniques, ensuring
session unlinkability for packets following the same path.
  Ariadne enhances previous approaches to preserve communication privacy by
introducing two novelties. First, the source route is encoded in a fixed size,
sequentially encrypted vector of routing information elements, in which the
elements' positions in the vector are pseudo-randomly permuted. Second, the
temporary keys used to process the packets on the path are referenced using
mutually known encrypted patterns. This avoids the use of an explicit key
reference that could be used to de-anonymize the communications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We propose reconstruction advantage measures to audit label privatization
mechanisms. A reconstruction advantage measure quantifies the increase in an
attacker's ability to infer the true label of an unlabeled example when
provided with a private version of the labels in a dataset (e.g., aggregate of
labels from different users or noisy labels output by randomized response),
compared to an attacker that only observes the feature vectors, but may have
prior knowledge of the correlation between features and labels. We consider two
such auditing measures: one additive, and one multiplicative. These incorporate
previous approaches taken in the literature on empirical auditing and
differential privacy. The measures allow us to place a variety of proposed
privatization schemes -- some differentially private, some not -- on the same
footing. We analyze these measures theoretically under a distributional model
which encapsulates reasonable adversarial settings. We also quantify their
behavior empirically on real and simulated prediction tasks. Across a range of
experimental settings, we find that differentially private schemes dominate or
match the privacy-utility tradeoff of more heuristic approaches.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Online advertising is a cornerstone of the Internet ecosystem, with
advertising measurement playing a crucial role in optimizing efficiency. Ad
measurement entails attributing desired behaviors, such as purchases, to ad
exposures across various platforms, necessitating the collection of user
activities across these platforms. As this practice faces increasing
restrictions due to rising privacy concerns, safeguarding user privacy in this
context is imperative. Our work is the first to formulate the real-world
challenge of advertising measurement systems with real-time reporting of
streaming data in advertising campaigns. We introduce Ads-BPC, a novel
user-level differential privacy protection scheme for advertising measurement
results. This approach optimizes global noise power and results in a
non-identically distributed noise distribution that preserves differential
privacy while enhancing measurement accuracy. Through experiments on both
real-world advertising campaigns and synthetic datasets, Ads-BPC achieves a 25%
to 50% increase in accuracy over existing streaming DP mechanisms applied to
advertising measurement. This highlights our method's effectiveness in
achieving superior accuracy alongside a formal privacy guarantee, thereby
advancing the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving advertising measurement.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study the contextual dynamic pricing problem where a firm sells products
to $T$ sequentially arriving consumers that behave according to an unknown
demand model. The firm aims to maximize its revenue, i.e. minimize its regret
over a clairvoyant that knows the model in advance. The demand model is a
generalized linear model (GLM), allowing for a stochastic feature vector in
$\mathbb R^d$ that encodes product and consumer information. We first show that
the optimal regret upper bound is of order $\sqrt{dT}$, up to a logarithmic
factor, improving upon existing upper bounds in the literature by a $\sqrt{d}$
factor. This sharper rate is materialised by two algorithms: a confidence
bound-type (supCB) algorithm and an explore-then-commit (ETC) algorithm. A key
insight of our theoretical result is an intrinsic connection between dynamic
pricing and the contextual multi-armed bandit problem with many arms based on a
careful discretization. We further study contextual dynamic pricing under the
local differential privacy (LDP) constraints. In particular, we propose a
stochastic gradient descent based ETC algorithm that achieves an optimal regret
upper bound of order $d\sqrt{T}/\epsilon$, up to a logarithmic factor, where
$\epsilon>0$ is the privacy parameter. The regret upper bounds with and without
LDP constraints are accompanied by newly constructed minimax lower bounds,
which further characterize the cost of privacy. Extensive numerical experiments
and a real data application on online lending are conducted to illustrate the
efficiency and practical value of the proposed algorithms in dynamic pricing.</p>

spatial and temporal attention blocks in the discriminator and a spatiotemporal
deconvolution structure in the generator. These enhancements enable efficient
training under Gaussian noise to achieve differential privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets validate the
efficacy of our model. Our method provides a privacy guarantee while

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As privacy-preserving becomes a pivotal aspect of deep learning (DL)
development, multi-party computation (MPC) has gained prominence for its
efficiency and strong security. However, the practice of current MPC frameworks
is limited, especially when dealing with large neural networks, exemplified by
the prolonged execution time of 25.8 seconds for secure inference on
ResNet-152. The primary challenge lies in the reliance of current MPC
approaches on additive secret sharing, which incurs significant communication
overhead with non-linear operations such as comparisons. Furthermore, additive
sharing suffers from poor scalability on party size. In contrast, the evolving
landscape of MPC necessitates accommodating a larger number of compute parties
and ensuring robust performance against malicious activities or computational
failures.
  In light of these challenges, we propose SSNet, which for the first time,
employs Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) as the backbone of MPC-based ML
framework. We meticulously develop all framework primitives and operations for
secure DL models tailored to seamlessly integrate with the SSS scheme. SSNet
demonstrates the ability to scale up party numbers straightforwardly and embeds
strategies to authenticate the computation correctness without incurring
significant performance overhead. Additionally, SSNet introduces masking
strategies designed to reduce communication overhead associated with non-linear
operations. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations on commercial
cloud computing infrastructure from Amazon AWS, as well as across diverse
prevalent DNN models and datasets. SSNet demonstrates a substantial performance
boost, achieving speed-ups ranging from 3x to 14x compared to SOTA MPC
frameworks. Moreover, SSNet also represents the first framework that is
evaluated on a five-party computation setup, in the context of secure DL

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The advent of online genomic data-sharing services has sought to enhance the
accessibility of large genomic datasets by allowing queries about genetic
variants, such as summary statistics, aiding care providers in distinguishing
between spurious genomic variations and those with clinical significance.
However, numerous studies have demonstrated that even sharing summary genomic
information exposes individual members of such datasets to a significant
privacy risk due to membership inference attacks. While several approaches have
emerged that reduce privacy risks by adding noise or reducing the amount of
information shared, these typically assume non-adaptive attacks that use
likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics. We propose a Bayesian game-theoretic
framework for optimal privacy-utility tradeoff in the sharing of genomic
summary statistics. Our first contribution is to prove that a very general
Bayesian attacker model that anchors our game-theoretic approach is more
powerful than the conventional LRT-based threat models in that it induces worse
privacy loss for the defender who is modeled as a von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM)
decision-maker. We show this to be true even when the attacker uses a
non-informative subjective prior. Next, we present an analytically tractable
approach to compare the Bayesian attacks with arbitrary subjective priors and
the Neyman-Pearson optimal LRT attacks under the Gaussian mechanism common in
differential privacy frameworks. Finally, we propose an approach for
approximating Bayes-Nash equilibria of the game using deep neural network
generators to implicitly represent player mixed strategies. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed game-theoretic framework yields both stronger
attacks and stronger defense strategies than the state of the art.</p>

services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure
of private information in user inputs to eavesdroppers or untrustworthy service
providers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from
insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or severe inference
time overhead. In this paper, we propose PrivacyRestore to protect the privacy
of user inputs during LLM inference. PrivacyRestore directly removes privacy
spans in user inputs and restores privacy information via activation steering
during inference. The privacy spans are encoded as restoration vectors. We
propose Attention-aware Weighted Aggregation (AWA) which aggregates restoration
vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a meta restoration vector. AWA
not only ensures proper representation of all privacy spans but also prevents
attackers from inferring the privacy spans from the meta restoration vector
alone. This meta restoration vector, along with the query with privacy spans
removed, is then sent to the server. The experimental results show that
PrivacyRestore can protect private information while maintaining acceptable
levels of performance and inference efficiency.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a collaborative approach that allows
multiple clients to jointly learn a machine learning model without sharing
their private data. The concern about privacy leakage, albeit demonstrated
under specific conditions, has triggered numerous follow-up research in
designing powerful attacking methods and effective defending mechanisms aiming
to thwart these attacking methods. Nevertheless, privacy-preserving mechanisms
employed in these defending methods invariably lead to compromised model
performances due to a fixed obfuscation applied to private data or gradients.
In this article, we, therefore, propose a novel adaptive obfuscation mechanism,
coined FedAdOb, to protect private data without yielding original model
performances. Technically, FedAdOb utilizes passport-based adaptive obfuscation
to ensure data privacy in both horizontal and vertical federated learning
settings. The privacy-preserving capabilities of FedAdOb, specifically with
regard to private features and labels, are theoretically proven through
Theorems 1 and 2. Furthermore, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on
various datasets and network architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of
FedAdOb by manifesting its superior trade-off between privacy preservation and
model performance, surpassing existing methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning allows several clients to train one machine learning model
jointly without sharing private data, providing privacy protection. However,
traditional federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, which can
not only decrease the model performance, but also implant malicious backdoors.
In addition, direct submission of local model parameters can also lead to the
privacy leakage of the training dataset. In this paper, we aim to build a
privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme to provide an
environment with no vandalism (NoV) against attacks from malicious
participants. Specifically, we construct a model filter for poisoned local
models, protecting the global model from data and model poisoning attacks. This
model filter combines zero-knowledge proofs to provide further privacy
protection. Then, we adopt secret sharing to provide verifiable secure
aggregation, removing malicious clients that disrupting the aggregation
process. Our formal analysis proves that NoV can protect data privacy and weed
out Byzantine attackers. Our experiments illustrate that NoV can effectively
address data and model poisoning attacks, including PGD, and outperforms other
related schemes.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Unlearning (FU) is gaining prominence for its capacity to eliminate
influences of Federated Learning (FL) users' data from trained global FL
models. A straightforward FU method involves removing the unlearned users and
subsequently retraining a new global FL model from scratch with all remaining
users, a process that leads to considerable overhead. To enhance unlearning
efficiency, a widely adopted strategy employs clustering, dividing FL users
into clusters, with each cluster maintaining its own FL model. The final
inference is then determined by aggregating the majority vote from the
inferences of these sub-models. This method confines unlearning processes to
individual clusters for removing a user, thereby enhancing unlearning
efficiency by eliminating the need for participation from all remaining users.
However, current clustering-based FU schemes mainly concentrate on refining
clustering to boost unlearning efficiency but overlook the potential
information leakage from FL users' gradients, a privacy concern that has been
extensively studied. Typically, integrating secure aggregation (SecAgg) schemes
within each cluster can facilitate a privacy-preserving FU. Nevertheless,
crafting a clustering methodology that seamlessly incorporates SecAgg schemes
is challenging, particularly in scenarios involving adversarial users and
dynamic users. In this connection, we systematically explore the integration of
SecAgg protocols within the most widely used federated unlearning scheme, which
is based on clustering, to establish a privacy-preserving FU framework, aimed
at ensuring privacy while effectively managing dynamic user participation.
Comprehensive theoretical assessments and experimental results show that our
proposed scheme achieves comparable unlearning effectiveness, alongside
offering improved privacy protection and resilience in the face of varying user
participation.</p>

de-identification of dynamic medical imaging data. Until now, generative
methods have faced constraints in terms of fidelity, spatio-temporal coherence,
and the length of generation, failing to capture the complete details of
dataset distributions. We present a model designed to produce high-fidelity,
long and complete data samples with near-real-time efficiency and explore our
approach on a challenging task: generating echocardiogram videos. We develop
our generation method based on diffusion models and introduce a protocol for
medical video dataset anonymization. As an exemplar, we present
EchoNet-Synthetic, a fully synthetic, privacy-compliant echocardiogram dataset
with paired ejection fraction labels. As part of our de-identification
protocol, we evaluate the quality of the generated dataset and propose to use
clinical downstream tasks as a measurement on top of widely used but
potentially biased image quality metrics. Experimental outcomes demonstrate
that EchoNet-Synthetic achieves comparable dataset fidelity to the actual
dataset, effectively supporting the ejection fraction regression task. Code,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy mechanisms such as the Gaussian or Laplace mechanism
have been widely used in data analytics for preserving individual privacy.
However, they are mostly designed for continuous outputs and are unsuitable for
scenarios where discrete values are necessary. Although various quantization
mechanisms were proposed recently to generate discrete outputs under
differential privacy, the outcomes are either biased or have an inferior
accuracy-privacy trade-off. In this paper, we propose a family of quantization
mechanisms that is unbiased and differentially private. It has a high degree of
freedom and we show that some existing mechanisms can be considered as special
cases of ours. To find the optimal mechanism, we formulate a linear
optimization that can be solved efficiently using linear programming tools.
Experiments show that our proposed mechanism can attain a better
privacy-accuracy trade-off compared to baselines.</p>

process: a) data acquisition through sensing, b) feature extraction, and c)
feature encoding for transmission. Transmission of the extracted features
entails the potential risk of exposing sensitive personal data. To address this
issue, in this work a new privacy-protecting collaborative inference mechanism

the privacy of extracted features before transmitting them to a central server
for inference. This mechanism aims to achieve two main objectives while
ensuring effective inference performance: 1) reducing communication overhead,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Meta-learning involves multiple learners, each dedicated to specific tasks,
collaborating in a data-constrained setting. In current meta-learning methods,
task learners locally learn models from sensitive data, termed support sets.
These task learners subsequently share model-related information, such as
gradients or loss values, which is computed using another part of the data
termed query set, with a meta-learner. The meta-learner employs this
information to update its meta-knowledge. Despite the absence of explicit data
sharing, privacy concerns persist. This paper examines potential data leakage
in a prominent metalearning algorithm, specifically Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML). In MAML, gradients are shared between the metalearner and
task-learners. The primary objective is to scrutinize the gradient and the
information it encompasses about the task dataset. Subsequently, we endeavor to
propose membership inference attacks targeting the task dataset containing
support and query sets. Finally, we explore various noise injection methods
designed to safeguard the privacy of task data and thwart potential attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks on MAML and
the efficacy of proper noise injection methods in countering them.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The growing popular awareness of personal privacy raises the following
quandary: what is the new paradigm for collecting and protecting the data
produced by ever-increasing sensor devices. Most previous studies on co-design
of data aggregation and privacy preservation assume that a trusted fusion
center adheres to privacy regimes. Very recent work has taken steps towards
relaxing the assumption by allowing data contributors to locally perturb their
own data. Although these solutions withhold some data content to mitigate
privacy risks, they have been shown to offer insufficient protection against
disclosure attacks. Aiming at providing a more rigorous data safeguard for the
Internet of Things (IoTs), this paper initiates the study of privacy-preserving
data aggregation. We propose a novel paradigm (called RASE), which can be
generalized into a 3-step sequential procedure, noise addition, followed by
random permutation, and then parameter estimation. Specially, we design a
differentially private randomizer, which carefully guides data contributors to
obfuscate the truth. Then, a shuffler is employed to receive the noisy data
from all data contributors. After that, it breaks the correct linkage between
senders and receivers by applying a random permutation. The estimation phase
involves using inaccurate data to calculate an approximate aggregate value.
Extensive simulations are provided to explore the privacy-utility landscape of
our RASE.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The number and dynamic nature of web and mobile applications presents
significant challenges for assessing their compliance with data protection

(NLP) techniques have been employed for the automated analysis of these
systems' privacy policies. However, these techniques typically require
labor-intensive and potentially error-prone manually annotated datasets for
training and validation. This research proposes the application of Large

extracting privacy practices from privacy policies at scale. Particularly, we
leverage well-known LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama 2, and offer guidance on the
optimal design of prompts, parameters, and models, incorporating advanced
strategies such as few-shot learning. We further illustrate its capability to
detect detailed and varied privacy practices accurately. Using several renowned
datasets in the domain as a benchmark, our evaluation validates its exceptional
performance, achieving an F1 score exceeding 93%. Besides, it does so with
reduced costs, faster processing times, and fewer technical knowledge
requirements. Consequently, we advocate for LLM-based solutions as a sound
alternative to traditional NLP techniques for the automated analysis of privacy
policies at scale.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series
forecasting in industrial applications, such as predictive maintenance and
machine control. Critical challenges to address in manufacturing include data
privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and
inference. Additionally, to increase industry adaptability, such forecasting
models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong
convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address those challenges and propose
'Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL' (STV), a novel framework that
exhibits the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for
forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically partitioned
data; ii) serverless forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party
computation; iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and
inverse operations for direct parameter optimization, giving strong convergence
with minimal hyperparameter tuning complexity. We conduct evaluations on six
representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Our results
demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of
centralized approaches. They also show that our direct optimization can
outperform centralized methods, which include state-of-the-art diffusion models
and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also conduct
a scalability analysis by examining the communication costs of direct and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Individuals and businesses have been significantly benefited by Large
Language Models (LLMs) including PaLM, Gemini and ChatGPT in various ways. For
example, LLMs enhance productivity, reduce costs, and enable us to focus on
more valuable tasks. Furthermore, LLMs possess the capacity to sift through
extensive datasets, uncover underlying patterns, and furnish critical insights
that propel the frontiers of technology and science. However, LLMs also pose
privacy concerns. Users' interactions with LLMs may expose their sensitive
personal or company information. A lack of robust privacy safeguards and legal
frameworks could permit the unwarranted intrusion or improper handling of
individual data, thereby risking infringements of privacy and the theft of
personal identities. To ensure privacy, it is essential to minimize the
dependency between shared prompts and private information. Various
randomization approaches have been proposed to protect prompts' privacy, but
they may incur utility loss compared to unprotected LLMs prompting. Therefore,
it is essential to evaluate the balance between the risk of privacy leakage and
loss of utility when conducting effective protection mechanisms. The current
study develops a framework for inferring privacy-protected Large Language
Models (LLMs) and lays down a solid theoretical basis for examining the
interplay between privacy preservation and utility. The core insight is
encapsulated within a theorem that is called as the NFL (abbreviation of the
word No-Free-Lunch) Theorem.</p>

collaborative graph analytics under differential privacy. Although
differentially private graph analysis has been widely studied, it fails to
achieve a good tradeoff between utility and privacy in federated scenarios, due
to the limited view of local clients and overlapping information across
multiple subgraphs. Motivated by this, we first propose a federated graph
analytic framework, named FEAT, which enables arbitrary downstream common graph
statistics while preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, we introduce an
optimized framework based on our proposed degree-based partition algorithm,
called FEAT+, which improves the overall utility by leveraging the true local

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning models have recently enjoyed a significant increase in size
and popularity. However, this growth has created concerns about dataset
privacy. To counteract data leakage, various privacy frameworks guarantee that
the output of machine learning models does not compromise their training data.
However, this privatization comes at a cost by adding random noise to the
training process, which reduces model performance. By making models more
resistant to small changes in input and thus more stable, the necessary amount
of noise can be decreased while still protecting privacy. This paper
investigates various techniques to enhance stability, thereby minimizing the
negative effects of privatization in machine learning.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recommender systems are an integral part of online platforms that recommend
new content to users with similar interests. However, they demand a
considerable amount of user activity data where, if the data is not adequately
protected, constitute a critical threat to the user privacy. Privacy-aware
recommender systems enable protection of such sensitive user data while still
maintaining a similar recommendation accuracy compared to the traditional
non-private recommender systems. However, at present, the current privacy-aware
recommender systems suffer from a significant trade-off between privacy and
computational efficiency. For instance, it is well known that architectures
that rely purely on cryptographic primitives offer the most robust privacy
guarantees, however, they suffer from substantial computational and network
overhead. Thus, it is crucial to improve this trade-off for better performance.
This paper presents a novel privacy-aware recommender system that combines
privacy-aware machine learning algorithms for practical scalability and
efficiency with cryptographic primitives like Homomorphic Encryption and
Multi-Party Computation - without assumptions like trusted-party or secure
hardware - for solid privacy guarantees. Experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show that our approach results in time and memory gains by three
orders of magnitude compared to using cryptographic primitives in a standalone
for constructing a privacy-aware recommender system. Furthermore, for the first
time our method makes it feasible to compute private recommendations for
datasets containing 100 million entries, even on memory-constrained low-power

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We study differentially private (DP) mean estimation in the case where each
person holds multiple samples. Commonly referred to as the "user-level"
setting, DP here requires the usual notion of distributional stability when all
of a person's datapoints can be modified. Informally, if $n$ people each have
$m$ samples from an unknown $d$-dimensional distribution with bounded $k$-th
moments, we show that
  \[n = \tilde \Theta\left(\frac{d}{\alpha^2 m} + \frac{d }{ \alpha m^{1/2}
\varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\alpha^{k/(k-1)} m \varepsilon} +
\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\]
  people are necessary and sufficient to estimate the mean up to distance
$\alpha$ in $\ell_2$-norm under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (and its
common relaxations). In the multivariate setting, we give computationally
efficient algorithms under approximate DP (with slightly degraded sample
complexity) and computationally inefficient algorithms under pure DP, and our
nearly matching lower bounds hold for the most permissive case of approximate
DP. Our computationally efficient estimators are based on the well known
noisy-clipped-mean approach, but the analysis for our setting requires new
bounds on the tails of sums of independent, vector-valued, bounded-moments
random variables, and a new argument for bounding the bias introduced by
clipping.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The study of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural Language Processing often
views the task of text privatization as a $\textit{rewriting}$ task, in which
sensitive input texts are rewritten to hide explicit or implicit private
information. In order to evaluate the privacy-preserving capabilities of a DP
text rewriting mechanism, $\textit{empirical privacy}$ tests are frequently
employed. In these tests, an adversary is modeled, who aims to infer sensitive
information (e.g., gender) about the author behind a (privatized) text. Looking
to improve the empirical protections provided by DP rewriting methods, we
propose a simple post-processing method based on the goal of aligning rewritten
texts with their original counterparts, where DP rewritten texts are rewritten
$\textit{again}$. Our results show that such an approach not only produces
outputs that are more semantically reminiscent of the original inputs, but also
texts which score on average better in empirical privacy evaluations.
Therefore, our approach raises the bar for DP rewriting methods in their
empirical privacy evaluations, providing an extra layer of protection against
malicious adversaries.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Extending knowledge by identifying and investigating valuable research
questions and problems is a core function of research. Research publications
often suggest avenues for future work to extend and build upon their results.
Considering these suggestions can contribute to developing research ideas that
build upon previous work and produce results that tie into existing knowledge.
Usable security and privacy researchers commonly add future work statements to
their publications. However, our community lacks an in-depth understanding of
their prevalence, quality, and impact on future research.
  Our work aims to address this gap in the research literature. We reviewed all
27 papers from the 2019 SOUPS proceedings and analyzed their future work
statements. Additionally, we analyzed 978 publications that cite any paper from
SOUPS 2019 proceedings to assess their future work statements' impact. We find
that most papers from the SOUPS 2019 proceedings include future work
statements. However, they are often unspecific or ambiguous, and not always
easy to find. Therefore, the citing publications often matched the future work
statements' content thematically, but rarely explicitly acknowledged them,
indicating a limited impact. We conclude with recommendations for the usable
security and privacy community to improve the utility of future work statements
by making them more tangible and actionable, and avenues for future work.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach
that keeps data localized and often incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to
enhance privacy guarantees. Similar to previous work on DP in ML, we observed
that differentially private federated learning (DPFL) introduces performance
disparities, particularly affecting minority groups. Recent work has attempted
to address performance fairness in vanilla FL through clustering, but this
method remains sensitive and prone to errors, which are further exacerbated by
the DP noise in DPFL. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel
clustered DPFL algorithm designed to effectively identify clients' clusters in
highly heterogeneous settings while maintaining high accuracy with DP
guarantees. To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their
model updates and training loss values. Our proposed approach also addresses
the server's uncertainties in clustering clients' model updates by employing
larger batch sizes along with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to alleviate the
impact of noise and potential clustering errors, especially in
privacy-sensitive scenarios. We provide theoretical analysis of the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also extensively evaluate our
approach across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets and show its
effectiveness in mitigating the disparate impact of DP in FL settings with a
small computational cost.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Graph encryption schemes play a crucial role in facilitating secure queries
on encrypted graphs hosted on untrusted servers. With applications spanning
navigation systems, network topology, and social networks, the need to
safeguard sensitive data becomes paramount. Existing graph encryption methods,
however, exhibit vulnerabilities by inadvertently revealing aspects of the
graph structure and query patterns, posing threats to security and privacy. In
response, we propose a novel graph encryption scheme designed to mitigate
access pattern and query pattern leakage through the integration of oblivious
RAM and trusted execution environment techniques, exemplified by a Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE). Our solution establishes two key security
objectives: (1) ensuring that adversaries, when presented with an encrypted
graph, remain oblivious to any information regarding the underlying graph, and
(2) achieving query indistinguishability by concealing access patterns.
Additionally, we conducted experimentation to evaluate the efficiency of the
proposed schemes when dealing with real-world location navigation services.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Emerging discussions on the responsible government use of algorithmic
technologies propose transparency and public participation as key mechanisms
for preserving accountability and trust. But in practice, the adoption and use
of any technology shifts the social, organizational, and political context in
which it is embedded. Therefore translating transparency and participation
efforts into meaningful, effective accountability must take into account these
shifts. We adopt two theoretical frames, Mulligan and Nissenbaum's handoff
model and Star and Griesemer's boundary objects, to reveal such shifts during
the U.S. Census Bureau's adoption of differential privacy (DP) in its updated
disclosure avoidance system (DAS) for the 2020 census. This update preserved
(and arguably strengthened) the confidentiality protections that the Bureau is
mandated to uphold, and the Bureau engaged in a range of activities to
facilitate public understanding of and participation in the system design
process. Using publicly available documents concerning the Census'
implementation of DP, this case study seeks to expand our understanding of how
technical shifts implicate values, how such shifts can afford (or fail to
afford) greater transparency and participation in system design, and the
importance of localized expertise throughout. We present three lessons from
this case study toward grounding understandings of algorithmic transparency and
participation: (1) efforts towards transparency and participation in
algorithmic governance must center values and policy decisions, not just
technical design decisions; (2) the handoff model is a useful tool for
revealing how such values may be cloaked beneath technical decisions; and (3)
boundary objects alone cannot bridge distant communities without trusted
experts traveling alongside to broker their adoption.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Smart meters play a crucial role in enhancing energy management and
efficiency, but they raise significant privacy concerns by potentially
revealing detailed user behaviors through energy consumption patterns. Recent
scholarly efforts have focused on developing battery-aided load-shaping
techniques to protect user privacy while balancing costs. This paper proposes a
novel deep reinforcement learning-based load-shaping algorithm (PLS-DQN)
designed to protect user privacy by proactively creating artificial load
signatures that mislead potential attackers. We evaluate our proposed algorithm
against a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) adversary. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only effectively conceals real energy usage
patterns but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing user

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Handling missing data is crucial in machine learning, but many datasets
contain gaps due to errors or non-response. Unlike traditional methods such as
listwise deletion, which are simple but inadequate, the literature offers more
sophisticated and effective methods, thereby improving sample size and
accuracy. However, these methods require accessing the whole dataset, which
contradicts the privacy regulations when the data is distributed among multiple
sources. Especially in the medical and healthcare domain, such access reveals
sensitive information about patients. This study addresses privacy-preserving
imputation methods for sensitive data using secure multi-party computation,
enabling secure computations without revealing any party's sensitive
information. In this study, we realized the mean, median, regression, and kNN
imputation methods in a privacy-preserving way. We specifically target the
medical and healthcare domains considering the significance of protection of
the patient data, showcasing our methods on a diabetes dataset. Experiments on
the diabetes dataset validated the correctness of our privacy-preserving
imputation methods, yielding the largest error around $3 \times 10^{-3}$,
closely matching plaintext methods. We also analyzed the scalability of our
methods to varying numbers of samples, showing their applicability to
real-world healthcare problems. Our analysis demonstrated that all our methods
scale linearly with the number of samples. Except for kNN, the runtime of all

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving machine learning
paradigm that allows data owners to collaboratively train models while keeping
their data localized. Despite its potential, FL faces challenges related to the
trustworthiness of both clients and servers, especially in the presence of
curious or malicious adversaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework
named \underline{\textbf{F}}ederated \underline{\textbf{L}}earning with
\underline{\textbf{U}}pdate \underline{\textbf{D}}igest (FLUD), which addresses
the critical issues of privacy preservation and resistance to Byzantine attacks
within distributed learning environments. FLUD utilizes an innovative approach,
the $\mathsf{LinfSample}$ method, allowing clients to compute the $l_{\infty}$
norm across sliding windows of updates as an update digest. This digest enables
the server to calculate a shared distance matrix, significantly reducing the
overhead associated with Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) by three orders
of magnitude while effectively distinguishing between benign and malicious
updates. Additionally, FLUD integrates a privacy-preserving, voting-based
defense mechanism that employs optimized SMPC protocols to minimize
communication rounds. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FLUD's
effectiveness in countering Byzantine adversaries while incurring low
communication and runtime overhead. FLUD offers a scalable framework for secure

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Mobile Health (mHealth) applications have become a crucial part of health
monitoring and management. However, the proliferation of these applications has
also raised concerns over the privacy and security of Personally Identifiable
Information and Protected Health Information. Addressing these concerns, this
paper introduces a novel framework for the qualitative evaluation of privacy
practices in mHealth apps, particularly focusing on the handling and
transmission of sensitive user data. Our investigation encompasses an analysis
of 152 leading mHealth apps on the Android platform, leveraging the proposed
framework to provide a multifaceted view of their data processing activities.
Despite stringent regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation in
the European Union and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
in the United States, our findings indicate persistent issues with negligence
and misuse of sensitive user information. We uncover significant instances of
health information leakage to third-party trackers and a widespread neglect of
privacy-by-design and transparency principles. Our research underscores the
critical need for stricter enforcement of data protection laws and sets a

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We consider the problem of computing tight privacy guarantees for the
composition of subsampled differentially private mechanisms. Recent algorithms
can numerically compute the privacy parameters to arbitrary precision but must
be carefully applied.
  Our main contribution is to address two common points of confusion. First,
some privacy accountants assume that the privacy guarantees for the composition
of a subsampled mechanism are determined by self-composing the worst-case
datasets for the uncomposed mechanism. We show that this is not true in
general. Second, Poisson subsampling is sometimes assumed to have similar
privacy guarantees compared to sampling without replacement. We show that the
privacy guarantees may in fact differ significantly between the two sampling
schemes. In particular, we give an example of hyperparameters that result in
$\varepsilon \approx 1$ for Poisson subsampling and $\varepsilon > 10$ for
sampling without replacement. This occurs for some parameters that could
realistically be chosen for DP-SGD.</p>

technologies become integral to everyday life. To this end, we introduce a new
benchmark PrivBench, which contains images from 8 sensitive categories such as
passports, or fingerprints. We evaluate 10 state-of-the-art VLMs on this
benchmark and observe a generally limited understanding of privacy,
highlighting a significant area for model improvement. Based on this we
introduce PrivTune, a new instruction-tuning dataset aimed at equipping VLMs
with knowledge about visual privacy. By tuning two pretrained VLMs, TinyLLaVa
and MiniGPT-v2, on this small dataset, we achieve strong gains in their ability
to recognize sensitive content, outperforming even GPT4-V. At the same time, we
show that privacy-tuning only minimally affects the VLMs performance on
standard benchmarks such as VQA. Overall, this paper lays out a crucial

    <p><b>Summary:</b> User-level privacy is important in distributed systems. Previous research
primarily focuses on the central model, while the local models have received
much less attention. Under the central model, user-level DP is strictly
stronger than the item-level one. However, under the local model, the
relationship between user-level and item-level LDP becomes more complex, thus
the analysis is crucially different. In this paper, we first analyze the mean
estimation problem and then apply it to stochastic optimization,
classification, and regression. In particular, we propose adaptive strategies
to achieve optimal performance at all privacy levels. Moreover, we also obtain
information-theoretic lower bounds, which show that the proposed methods are
minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. Unlike the central DP model, where
user-level DP always leads to slower convergence, our result shows that under
the local model, the convergence rates are nearly the same between user-level
and item-level cases for distributions with bounded support. For heavy-tailed
distributions, the user-level rate is even faster than the item-level one.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper is concerned with the security problem for interconnected systems,
where each subsystem is required to detect local attacks using locally
available information and the information received from its neighboring
subsystems. Moreover, we consider that there exists an additional eavesdropper
being able to infer the private information by eavesdropping transmitted data
between subsystems. Then, a privacy-preserving method is employed by adding
privacy noise to transmitted data, and the privacy level is measured by mutual
information. Nevertheless, adding privacy noise to transmitted data may affect
the detection performance metrics such as detection probability and false alarm
probability. Thus, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy
and the detection performance. An optimization problem with maximizing both the
degree of privacy preservation and the detection probability is established to
obtain the covariance of the privacy noise. In addition, the attack detector of
each subsystem may not obtain all information about the privacy noise. We
further theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy and the false
alarm probability when the attack detector has no knowledge of the privacy
noise covariance. An optimization problem with maximizing the degree of privacy
preservation with guaranteeing a bound of false alarm distortion level is
established to obtain {\color{black}{the covariance of the privacy noise}}.
Moreover, to analyze the effect of the privacy noise on the detection
probability, we consider that each subsystem can estimate the unknown privacy
noise covariance by the secondary data. Based on the estimated covariance, we
construct another attack detector and analyze how the privacy noise affects its
detection performance. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the
effectiveness of theoretical results.</p>

depiction of identifiable facial images, which could lead to malicious deepfake

Prompt Learning (APL) to address this problem. Specifically, we train a
learnable prompt prefix for text-to-image diffusion models, which forces the
model to generate anonymized facial identities, even when prompted to produce
images of specific individuals. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the successful anonymization performance of APL, which
anonymizes any specific individuals without compromising the quality of
non-identity-specific image generation. Furthermore, we reveal the
plug-and-play property of the learned prompt prefix, enabling its effective
application across different pretrained text-to-image models for transferrable

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) has been widely regarded as a promising paradigm for
privacy preservation of raw data in machine learning. Although, the data
privacy in FL is locally protected to some extent, it is still a desideratum to
enhance privacy and alleviate communication overhead caused by repetitively
transmitting model parameters. Typically, these challenges are addressed
separately, or jointly via a unified scheme that consists of noise-injected
privacy mechanism and communication compression, which may lead to model
corruption due to the introduced composite noise. In this work, we propose a
novel model-splitting privacy-preserving FL (MSP-FL) scheme to achieve private
FL with precise accuracy guarantee. Based upon MSP-FL, we further propose a
model-splitting privacy-preserving FL with dynamic quantization (MSPDQ-FL) to
mitigate the communication overhead, which incorporates a shrinking
quantization interval to reduce the quantization error. We provide privacy and
convergence analysis for both MSP-FL and MSPDQ-FL under non-i.i.d. dataset,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Running deep neural networks for large medical images is a resource-hungry
and time-consuming task with centralized computing. Outsourcing such medical
image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant
reduction of execution time and monetary cost. However, due to privacy
concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over
clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To
overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the
privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of
information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the
process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget
constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective method
called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed
extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images
using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the
workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide
range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies,
yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, makespan, and
monetary cost under user's budget.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In order to provide high-quality recommendations for users, it is desirable
to share and integrate multiple datasets held by different parties. However,
when sharing such distributed datasets, we need to protect personal and
confidential information contained in the datasets. To this end, we establish a
framework for privacy-preserving recommender systems using the data
collaboration analysis of distributed datasets. Numerical experiments with two
public rating datasets demonstrate that our privacy-preserving method for
rating prediction can improve the prediction accuracy for distributed datasets.
This study opens up new possibilities for privacy-preserving techniques in
recommender systems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Wearable devices that measure and record physiological signals are now
becoming widely available to the general public with ever-increasing
affordability and signal quality. The data from these devices introduce serious
ethical challenges that remain largely unaddressed. Users do not always
understand how these data can be leveraged to reveal private information about
them and developers of these devices may not fully grasp how physiological data
collected today could be used in the future for completely different purposes.
We discuss the potential for wearable devices, initially designed to help users
improve their well-being or enhance the experience of some digital application,
to be appropriated in ways that extend far beyond their original intended
purpose. We identify how the currently available technology can be misused,
discuss how pairing physiological data with non-physiological data can
radically expand the predictive capacity of physiological wearables, and
explore the implications of these expanded capacities for a variety of
stakeholders.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Label differential privacy (DP) is a framework that protects the privacy of
labels in training datasets, while the feature vectors are public. Existing
approaches protect the privacy of labels by flipping them randomly, and then
train a model to make the output approximate the privatized label. However, as
the number of classes $K$ increases, stronger randomization is needed, thus the
performances of these methods become significantly worse. In this paper, we
propose a vector approximation approach, which is easy to implement and
introduces little additional computational overhead. Instead of flipping each
label into a single scalar, our method converts each label into a random vector
with $K$ components, whose expectations reflect class conditional
probabilities. Intuitively, vector approximation retains more information than
scalar labels. A brief theoretical analysis shows that the performance of our
method only decays slightly with $K$. Finally, we conduct experiments on both
synthesized and real datasets, which validate our theoretical analysis as well
as the practical performance of our method.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Membership Inference Attacks have emerged as a dominant method for
empirically measuring privacy leakage from machine learning models. Here,
privacy is measured by the {\em{advantage}} or gap between a score or a
function computed on the training and the test data. A major barrier to the
practical deployment of these attacks is that they do not scale to large
well-generalized models -- either the advantage is relatively low, or the
attack involves training multiple models which is highly compute-intensive. In
this work, inspired by discrepancy theory, we propose a new empirical privacy
metric that is an upper bound on the advantage of a family of membership
inference attacks. We show that this metric does not involve training multiple
models, can be applied to large Imagenet classification models in-the-wild, and
has higher advantage than existing metrics on models trained with more recent
and sophisticated training recipes. Motivated by our empirical results, we also
propose new membership inference attacks tailored to these training losses.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning (ML) algorithms rely primarily on the availability of
training data, and, depending on the domain, these data may include sensitive
information about the data providers, thus leading to significant privacy
issues. Differential privacy (DP) is the predominant solution for
privacy-preserving ML, and the local model of DP is the preferred choice when
the server or the data collector are not trusted. Recent experimental studies
have shown that local DP can impact ML prediction for different subgroups of
individuals, thus affecting fair decision-making. However, the results are
conflicting in the sense that some studies show a positive impact of privacy on
fairness while others show a negative one. In this work, we conduct a
systematic and formal study of the effect of local DP on fairness.
Specifically, we perform a quantitative study of how the fairness of the
decisions made by the ML model changes under local DP for different levels of
privacy and data distributions. In particular, we provide bounds in terms of
the joint distributions and the privacy level, delimiting the extent to which
local DP can impact the fairness of the model. We characterize the cases in
which privacy reduces discrimination and those with the opposite effect. We
validate our theoretical findings on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our
results are preliminary in the sense that, for now, we study only the case of
one sensitive attribute, and only statistical disparity, conditional
statistical disparity, and equal opportunity difference.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The global increase in the elderly population necessitates innovative
long-term care solutions to improve the quality of life for vulnerable
individuals while reducing caregiver burdens. Assistive robots, leveraging
advancements in Machine Learning, offer promising personalised support.
However, their integration into daily life raises significant privacy concerns.
Widely used frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS) historically lack
inherent privacy mechanisms, complicating data-driven approaches in robotics.
This research pioneers user-centric, privacy-aware technologies such as
Federated Learning (FL) to advance assistive robotics. FL enables collaborative
learning without sharing sensitive data, addressing privacy and scalability
issues. This work includes developing solutions for smart wheelchair

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning models can be trained with formal privacy guarantees via
differentially private optimizers such as DP-SGD. In this work, we study such
privacy guarantees when the adversary only accesses the final model, i.e.,
intermediate model updates are not released. In the existing literature, this
hidden state threat model exhibits a significant gap between the lower bound
provided by empirical privacy auditing and the theoretical upper bound provided
by privacy accounting. To challenge this gap, we propose to audit this threat
model with adversaries that craft a gradient sequence to maximize the privacy
loss of the final model without accessing intermediate models. We demonstrate
experimentally how this approach consistently outperforms prior attempts at
auditing the hidden state model. When the crafted gradient is inserted at every
optimization step, our results imply that releasing only the final model does
not amplify privacy, providing a novel negative result. On the other hand, when
the crafted gradient is not inserted at every step, we show strong evidence
that a privacy amplification phenomenon emerges in the general non-convex
setting (albeit weaker than in convex regimes), suggesting that existing
privacy upper bounds can be improved.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> High dimensional sparse linear bandits serve as an efficient model for
sequential decision-making problems (e.g. personalized medicine), where high
dimensional features (e.g. genomic data) on the users are available, but only a
small subset of them are relevant. Motivated by data privacy concerns in these
applications, we study the joint differentially private high dimensional sparse
linear bandits, where both rewards and contexts are considered as private data.
First, to quantify the cost of privacy, we derive a lower bound on the regret
achievable in this setting. To further address the problem, we design a
computationally efficient bandit algorithm, \textbf{F}orgetfu\textbf{L}
\textbf{I}terative \textbf{P}rivate \textbf{HA}rd \textbf{T}hresholding
(FLIPHAT). Along with doubling of episodes and episodic forgetting, FLIPHAT
deploys a variant of Noisy Iterative Hard Thresholding (N-IHT) algorithm as a
sparse linear regression oracle to ensure both privacy and regret-optimality.
We show that FLIPHAT achieves optimal regret up to logarithmic factors. We
analyze the regret by providing a novel refined analysis of the estimation
error of N-IHT, which is of parallel interest.</p>

practices or highlighting specific privacy features, what do they actually
communicate to consumers? In this paper, we explore the impact of privacy
marketing materials on: (1) consumers' attitude towards the organizations
providing the campaigns, (2) overall privacy awareness, and (3) the
actionability of suggested privacy advice. To this end, we investigated the
impact of four privacy advertising videos and one privacy game published by
five different technology companies. We conducted 24 semi-structured interviews
with participants randomly assigned to view one or two of the videos or play
the game. Our findings suggest that awareness of privacy features can
contribute to positive perceptions of a company or its products. The ads we
tested were more successful in communicating the advertised privacy features
than the game we tested. We observed that advertising a single privacy feature
using a single metaphor in a short ad increased awareness of the advertised
feature. The game failed to communicate privacy features or motivate study
participants to use the features. Our results also suggest that privacy
campaigns can be useful for raising awareness about privacy features and
improving brand image, but may not be the most effective way to teach viewers
how to use privacy features.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Integrating blockchain technology with the Internet of Things offers
transformative possibilities for enhancing network security and privacy in the
contemporary digital landscape, where interconnected devices and expansive
networks are ubiquitous. This paper explores the pivotal role of artificial
intelligence in bolstering blockchain-enabled IoT systems, potentially marking
a significant leap forward in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality
across networks. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable
ledger, ideal for the secure management of device identities and transactions
in IoT networks. When coupled with AI, these systems gain the ability to not
only automate and optimize security protocols but also adaptively respond to
new and evolving cyber threats. This dual capability enhances the resilience of
networks against cyber-attacks, a critical consideration as IoT devices
increasingly permeate critical infrastructures. The synergy between AI and
blockchain in IoT is profound. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data
from IoT devices to detect patterns and anomalies that may signify security
breaches. Concurrently, blockchain can ensure that data records are
tamper-proof, enhancing the reliability of AI-driven security measures.
Moreover, this research evaluates the implications of AI-enhanced blockchain
systems on privacy protection within IoT networks. IoT devices often collect
sensitive personal data, making privacy a paramount concern. AI can facilitate
the development of new protocols that ensure data privacy and user anonymity
without compromising the functionality of IoT systems. Through comprehensive
analysis and case studies, this paper aims to provide an in-depth understanding
of how AI-enhanced blockchain technology can revolutionize network security and
privacy in IoT environments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Data sharing enables critical advances in many research areas and business
applications, but it may lead to inadvertent disclosure of sensitive summary
statistics (e.g., means or quantiles). Existing literature only focuses on
protecting a single confidential quantity, while in practice, data sharing
involves multiple sensitive statistics. We propose a novel framework to define,
analyze, and protect multi-secret summary statistics privacy in data sharing.
Specifically, we measure the privacy risk of any data release mechanism by the
worst-case probability of an attacker successfully inferring summary statistic
secrets. Given an attacker's objective spanning from inferring a subset to the
entirety of summary statistic secrets, we systematically design and analyze
tailored privacy metrics. Defining the distortion as the worst-case distance
between the original and released data distribution, we analyze the tradeoff
between privacy and distortion. Our contribution also includes designing and
analyzing data release mechanisms tailored for different data distributions and
secret types. Evaluations on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our mechanisms in practical applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> HTTP client hints are a set of standardized HTTP request headers designed to
modernize and potentially replace the traditional user agent string. While the
user agent string exposes a wide range of information about the client's
browser and device, client hints provide a controlled and structured approach
for clients to selectively disclose their capabilities and preferences to
servers. Essentially, client hints aim at more effective and privacy-friendly
disclosure of browser or client properties than the user agent string.
  We present a first long-term study of the use of HTTP client hints in the
wild. We found that despite being implemented in almost all web browsers,
server-side usage of client hints remains generally low. However, in the
context of third-party websites, which are often linked to trackers, the
adoption rate is significantly higher. This is concerning because client hints
allow the retrieval of more data from the client than the user agent string
provides, and there are currently no mechanisms for users to detect or control
this potential data leakage. Our work provides valuable insights for web users,
browser vendors, and researchers by exposing potential privacy violations via
client hints and providing help in developing remediation strategies as well as
further research.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy protection of users' entire contribution of samples is important in
distributed systems. The most effective approach is the two-stage scheme, which
finds a small interval first and then gets a refined estimate by clipping
samples into the interval. However, the clipping operation induces bias, which
is serious if the sample distribution is heavy-tailed. Besides, users with
large local sample sizes can make the sensitivity much larger, thus the method
is not suitable for imbalanced users. Motivated by these challenges, we propose
a Huber loss minimization approach to mean estimation under user-level
differential privacy. The connecting points of Huber loss can be adaptively
adjusted to deal with imbalanced users. Moreover, it avoids the clipping
operation, thus significantly reducing the bias compared with the two-stage
approach. We provide a theoretical analysis of our approach, which gives the
noise strength needed for privacy protection, as well as the bound of mean
squared error. The result shows that the new method is much less sensitive to
the imbalance of user-wise sample sizes and the tail of sample distributions.
Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical analysis.</p>

digital interaction, offering significant prospects for user engagement and
financial advancement. Nonetheless, this progress is shadowed by potential
privacy concessions, especially as these platforms frequently merge with
existing Web2.0 social media accounts, amplifying data privacy risks for users.
  In this study, we investigate the nuanced dynamics between user engagement on
Web3 social platforms and the consequent privacy concerns. We scrutinize the
widespread phenomenon of fabricated activities, which encompasses the
establishment of bogus accounts aimed at mimicking popularity and the
deliberate distortion of social interactions by some individuals to gain
financial rewards. Such deceptive maneuvers not only distort the true measure
of the active user base but also amplify privacy threats for all members of the
user community. We also find that, notwithstanding their attempts to limit
social exposure, users remain entangled in privacy vulnerabilities. The actions
of those highly engaged users, albeit often a minority group, can inadvertently
breach the privacy of the larger collective.
  By casting light on the delicate interplay between user engagement, financial
motives, and privacy issues, we offer a comprehensive examination of the
intrinsic challenges and hazards present in the Web3 social milieu. We
highlight the urgent need for more stringent privacy measures and ethical
protocols to navigate the complex web of social exchanges and financial
ambitions in the rapidly evolving Web3.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper proposes an optimal stochastic sampling approach to privacy, in
which a sensor observes a process which is correlated to private information,
and a sampler decides to keep or discard the sensor's observations. The kept
samples are shared with an adversary who might attempt to infer the private
process. The privacy leakages are captured with the mutual information between
the private process and sampler's output. We cast the optimal sampling design
as an optimization problem that (i) minimizes the reconstruction error of the
observed process using the sampler's output, (ii) and reduces privacy leakages.
We first show the optimal reconstruction is obtained by solving a one-step
optimization problem at each time step. We derive the optimality equations of
the sampler for a general processes via the dynamic decomposition method, and
show the sampler controls adversary's belief about the private input. Also, we
propose a simplified design for linear Gaussian processes by restricting the
sampling policy to a special collection. We show that the optimal
reconstruction of states, the belief state and the optimization objective can
be analytically expressed based on a conditional mean and covariance matrix. We
develop an numerical algorithm to optimize the sampling and reconstruction
policies based on the implicit function theorem. Finally, we verify our design
and show its capabilities in state reconstruction, privacy protection and data
size reduction via simulations.</p>

where each user has a single observation, but a growing field of interest is
that of user-level privacy where each of the $n$ users holds $T$ observations
and wishes to maintain the privacy of their entire collection.
  In this paper, we derive a general minimax lower bound, which shows that, for
locally private user-level estimation problems, the risk cannot, in general, be
made to vanish for a fixed number of users even when each user holds an
arbitrarily large number of observations. We then derive matching, up to
logarithmic factors, lower and upper bounds for univariate and multidimensional
mean estimation, sparse mean estimation and non-parametric density estimation.
In particular, with other model parameters held fixed, we observe phase
transition phenomena in the minimax rates as $T$ the number of observations
each user holds varies.
  In the case of (non-sparse) mean estimation and density estimation, we see
that, for $T$ below a phase transition boundary, the rate is the same as having
$nT$ users in the item-level setting. Different behaviour is however observed
in the case of $s$-sparse $d$-dimensional mean estimation, wherein consistent
estimation is impossible when $d$ exceeds the number of observations in the
item-level setting, but is possible in the user-level setting when $T \gtrsim s
\log (d)$, up to logarithmic factors. This may be of independent interest for
applications as an example of a high-dimensional problem that is feasible under
local privacy constraints.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Many real-world interconnections among entities can be characterized as
graphs. Collecting local graph information with balanced privacy and data
utility has garnered notable interest recently. This paper delves into the
problem of identifying and protecting critical information of entity
connections for individual participants in a graph based on cohesive subgraph
searches. This problem has not been addressed in the literature. To address the
problem, we propose to extract the critical connections of a queried vertex
using a fortress-like cohesive subgraph model known as $p$-cohesion. A user's
connections within a fortress are obfuscated when being released, to protect
critical information about the user. Novel merit and penalty score functions
are designed to measure each participant's critical connections in the minimal
$p$-cohesion, facilitating effective identification of the connections. We
further propose to preserve the privacy of a vertex enquired by only protecting
its critical connections when responding to queries raised by data collectors.
We prove that, under the decentralized differential privacy (DDP) mechanism,
one's response satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DDP when its critical
connections are protected while the rest remains unperturbed. The effectiveness
of our proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on
real-life graph datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The education technology (EdTech) landscape is expanding rapidly in higher
education institutes (HEIs). This growth brings enormous complexity. Protecting
the extensive data collected by these tools is crucial for HEIs. Privacy
incidents of data breaches and misuses can have dire security and privacy
consequences on the data subjects, particularly students, who are often
compelled to use these tools. This urges an in-depth understanding of HEI and
EdTech vendor dynamics, which is largely understudied.
  To address this gap, we conduct a semi-structured interview study with 13
participants who are in the EdTech leadership roles at seven HEIs. Our study
uncovers the EdTech acquisition process in the HEI context, the consideration
of security and privacy issues throughout that process, the pain points of HEI
personnel in establishing adequate security and privacy protection mechanisms
in service contracts, and their struggle in holding vendors accountable due to
a lack of visibility into their system and power-asymmetry, among other
reasons. We discuss certain observations about the status quo and conclude with

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This study proposes a framework to enhance privacy in Blockchain-based
Internet of Things (BIoT) systems used in the healthcare sector. The framework
addresses the challenge of leveraging health data for analytics while
protecting patient privacy. To achieve this, the study integrates Differential
Privacy (DP) with Federated Learning (FL) to protect sensitive health data
collected by IoT nodes. The proposed framework utilizes dynamic personalization
and adaptive noise distribution strategies to balance privacy and data utility.
Additionally, blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent aggregation
and storage of model updates. Experimental results on the SVHN dataset
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves strong privacy guarantees
against various attack scenarios while maintaining high accuracy in health
analytics tasks. For 15 rounds of federated learning with an epsilon value of
8.0, the model obtains an accuracy of 64.50%. The blockchain integration,
utilizing Ethereum, Ganache, Web3.py, and IPFS, exhibits an average transaction
latency of around 6 seconds and consistent gas consumption across rounds,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Join size estimation on sensitive data poses a risk of privacy leakage. Local
differential privacy (LDP) is a solution to preserve privacy while collecting
sensitive data, but it introduces significant noise when dealing with sensitive
join attributes that have large domains. Employing probabilistic structures
such as sketches is a way to handle large domains, but it leads to
hash-collision errors. To achieve accurate estimations, it is necessary to
reduce both the noise error and hash-collision error. To tackle the noise error
caused by protecting sensitive join values with large domains, we introduce a
novel algorithm called LDPJoinSketch for sketch-based join size estimation
under LDP. Additionally, to address the inherent hash-collision errors in
sketches under LDP, we propose an enhanced method called LDPJoinSketch+. It
utilizes a frequency-aware perturbation mechanism that effectively separates
high-frequency and low-frequency items without compromising privacy. The
proposed methods satisfy LDP, and the estimation error is bounded. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing methods, effectively
enhancing the accuracy of join size estimation under LDP.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Finding a robust security mechanism for audit trail logging has long been a
poorly satisfied goal. There are many reasons for this. The most significant of
these is that the audit trail is a highly sought after goal of attackers to
ensure that they do not get caught. Thus they have an incredibly strong
incentive to prevent companies from succeeding in this worthy aim. Regulation,
such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, has brought a
strong incentive for companies to achieve success in this area due to the
punitive level of fines that can now be levied in the event of a successful
breach by an attacker. We seek to resolve this issue through the use of an
encrypted audit trail process that saves encrypted records to a true immutable
database, which can ensure audit trail records are permanently retained in
encrypted form, with no possibility of the records being compromised. This
ensures compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation can be achieved.</p>

activity with 14 participants. The workbook depicts use case scenarios with
smart home camera technologies that involve surveillance and uneven power
relations. The scenarios were initially designed by the researchers to explore
scenarios of privacy and surveillance within three social relationships
involving "primary" and "non-primary" users: Parents-Children,
Landlords-Tenants, and Residents-Domestic Workers. When the scenarios were
utilized as part of a values elicitation activity with participants, we found
that they reflected on a broader set of interconnected social values beyond
privacy and surveillance, including autonomy and agency, physical safety,
property rights, trust and accountability, and fairness. The paper suggests
that future research about ethical issues in smart homes should conceptualize
privacy as interconnected with a broader set of social values (which can align
or be in tension with privacy), and reflects on considerations for doing
research with non-primary users.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Objectives: This work aims to explore the impact of multicenter data
heterogeneity on deep learning brain metastases (BM) autosegmentation
performance, and assess the efficacy of an incremental transfer learning
technique, namely learning without forgetting (LWF), to improve model
generalizability without sharing raw data.
  Materials and methods: A total of six BM datasets from University Hospital
Erlangen (UKER), University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Stanford, UCSF, NYU and
BraTS Challenge 2023 on BM segmentation were used for this evaluation. First,
the multicenter performance of a convolutional neural network (DeepMedic) for
BM autosegmentation was established for exclusive single-center training and
for training on pooled data, respectively. Subsequently bilateral collaboration
was evaluated, where a UKER pretrained model is shared to another center for
further training using transfer learning (TL) either with or without LWF.
  Results: For single-center training, average F1 scores of BM detection range
from 0.625 (NYU) to 0.876 (UKER) on respective single-center test data. Mixed
multicenter training notably improves F1 scores at Stanford and NYU, with
negligible improvement at other centers. When the UKER pretrained model is
applied to USZ, LWF achieves a higher average F1 score (0.839) than naive TL
(0.570) and single-center training (0.688) on combined UKER and USZ test data.
Naive TL improves sensitivity and contouring accuracy, but compromises
precision. Conversely, LWF demonstrates commendable sensitivity, precision and
contouring accuracy. When applied to Stanford, similar performance was
observed.
  Conclusion: Data heterogeneity results in varying performance in BM
autosegmentation, posing challenges to model generalizability. LWF is a
promising approach to peer-to-peer privacy-preserving model training.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper presents a novel approach to the digital signing of electronic
documents through the use of a camera-based interaction system, single-finger
tracking for sign recognition, and multi commands executing hand gestures. The
proposed solution, referred to as "Air Signature," involves writing the
signature in front of the camera, rather than relying on traditional methods
such as mouse drawing or physically signing on paper and showing it to a web
camera. The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art method for detecting and
tracking gestures and objects in real-time. The proposed methods include
applying existing gesture recognition and object tracking systems, improving
accuracy through smoothing and line drawing, and maintaining continuity during
fast finger movements. An evaluation of the fingertip detection, sketching, and
overall signing process is performed to assess the effectiveness of the
proposed solution. The secondary objective of this research is to develop a
model that can effectively recognize the unique signature of a user. This type
of signature can be verified by neural cores that analyze the movement, speed,
and stroke pixels of the signing in real time. The neural cores use machine
learning algorithms to match air signatures to the individual's stored
signatures, providing a secure and efficient method of verification. Our
proposed System does not require sensors or any hardware other than the camera.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recently, generative AI has attracted much attention from both academic and
industrial fields, which has shown its potential, especially in the data
generation and synthesis aspects. Simultaneously, secure and privacy-preserving
mobile crowdsensing (SPPMCS) has been widely applied in data collection/
acquirement due to an advantage on low deployment cost, flexible
implementation, and high adaptability. Since generative AI can generate new
synthetic data to replace the original data to be analyzed and processed, it
can lower data attacks and privacy leakage risks for the original data.
Therefore, integrating generative AI into SPPMCS is feasible and significant.
Moreover, this paper investigates an integration of generative AI in SPPMCS,
where we present potential research focuses, solutions, and case studies.
Specifically, we firstly review the preliminaries for generative AI and SPPMCS,
where their integration potential is presented. Then, we discuss research
issues and solutions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS, including security
defense of malicious data injection, illegal authorization, malicious spectrum
manipulation at the physical layer, and privacy protection on sensing data
content, sensing terminals' identification and location. Next, we propose a
framework for sensing data content protection with generative AI, and
simulations results have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that holds great promise for
privacy-preserving machine learning using distributed data. To enhance privacy,
FL can be combined with Differential Privacy (DP), which involves adding
Gaussian noise to the model weights. However, FL faces a significant challenge
in terms of large communication overhead when transmitting these model weights.
To address this issue, quantization is commonly employed. Nevertheless, the
presence of quantized Gaussian noise introduces complexities in understanding
privacy protection. This research paper investigates the impact of quantization
on privacy in FL systems. We examine the privacy guarantees of quantized
Gaussian mechanisms using R\'enyi Differential Privacy (RDP). By deriving the
privacy budget of quantized Gaussian mechanisms, we demonstrate that lower
quantization bit levels provide improved privacy protection. To validate our
theoretical findings, we employ Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which gauge
the accuracy of privacy leakage. The numerical results align with our
theoretical analysis, confirming that quantization can indeed enhance privacy
protection. This study not only enhances our understanding of the correlation
between privacy and communication in FL but also underscores the advantages of
quantization in preserving privacy.</p>

become prominent within the community. Many efforts have been made to mitigate
the privacy risks. However, the mechanism through which LLMs memorize PII
remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce a pioneering method
for pinpointing PII-sensitive neurons (privacy neurons) within LLMs. Our method
employs learnable binary weight masks to localize specific neurons that account
for the memorization of PII in LLMs through adversarial training. Our
investigations discover that PII is memorized by a small subset of neurons
across all layers, which shows the property of PII specificity. Furthermore, we
propose to validate the potential in PII risk mitigation by deactivating the
localized privacy neurons. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the rapid development of face recognition (FR) systems, the privacy of
face images on social media is facing severe challenges due to the abuse of
unauthorized FR systems. Some studies utilize adversarial attack techniques to
defend against malicious FR systems by generating adversarial examples.
However, the generated adversarial examples, i.e., the protected face images,
tend to suffer from subpar visual quality and low transferability. In this
paper, we propose a novel face protection approach, dubbed DiffAM, which
leverages the powerful generative ability of diffusion models to generate
high-quality protected face images with adversarial makeup transferred from
reference images. To be specific, we first introduce a makeup removal module to
generate non-makeup images utilizing a fine-tuned diffusion model with guidance
of textual prompts in CLIP space. As the inverse process of makeup transfer,
makeup removal can make it easier to establish the deterministic relationship
between makeup domain and non-makeup domain regardless of elaborate text
prompts. Then, with this relationship, a CLIP-based makeup loss along with an
ensemble attack strategy is introduced to jointly guide the direction of
adversarial makeup domain, achieving the generation of protected face images
with natural-looking makeup and high black-box transferability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DiffAM achieves higher visual quality and attack
success rates with a gain of 12.98% under black-box setting compared with the
state of the arts. The code will be available at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Ensuring the effectiveness of search queries while protecting user privacy
remains an open issue. When an Information Retrieval System (IRS) does not
protect the privacy of its users, sensitive information may be disclosed
through the queries sent to the system. Recent improvements, especially in NLP,
have shown the potential of using Differential Privacy to obfuscate texts while
maintaining satisfactory effectiveness. However, such approaches may protect
the user's privacy only from a theoretical perspective while, in practice, the
real user's information need can still be inferred if perturbed terms are too
semantically similar to the original ones. We overcome such limitations by
proposing Word Blending Boxes, a novel differentially private mechanism for
query obfuscation, which protects the words in the user queries by employing
safe boxes. To measure the overall effectiveness of the proposed WBB mechanism,
we measure the privacy obtained by the obfuscation process, i.e., the lexical
and semantic similarity between original and obfuscated queries. Moreover, we
assess the effectiveness of the privatized queries in retrieving relevant
documents from the IRS. Our findings indicate that WBB can be integrated
effectively into existing IRSs, offering a key to the challenge of protecting
user privacy from both a theoretical and a practical point of view.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Semantic communication (SemCom) enhances transmission efficiency by sending
only task-relevant information compared to traditional methods. However,
transmitting semantic-rich data over insecure or public channels poses security
and privacy risks. This paper addresses the privacy problem of transmitting
images over wiretap channels and proposes a novel SemCom approach ensuring
privacy through a differential privacy (DP)-based image protection and
deprotection mechanism. The method utilizes the GAN inversion technique to
extract disentangled semantic features and applies a DP mechanism to protect
sensitive features within the extracted semantic information. To address the
non-invertibility of DP, we introduce two neural networks to approximate the DP
application and removal processes, offering a privacy protection level close to
that by the original DP process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of our method in preventing eavesdroppers from obtaining sensitive information

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Abstract. Since the introduction of active discovery in Wi-Fi networks, users
can be tracked via their probe requests. Although manufacturers typically try
to conceal Media Access Control (MAC) addresses using MAC address
randomisation, probe requests still contain Information Elements (IEs) that
facilitate device identification. This paper introduces generic probe requests:
By removing all unnecessary information from IEs, the requests become
indistinguishable from one another, letting single devices disappear in the
largest possible anonymity set. Conducting a comprehensive evaluation, we
demonstrate that a large IE set contained within undirected probe requests does
not necessarily imply fast connection establishment. Furthermore, we show that
minimising IEs to nothing but Supported Rates would enable 82.55% of the
devices to share the same anonymity set. Our contributions provide a
significant advancement in the pursuit of robust privacy solutions for wireless
