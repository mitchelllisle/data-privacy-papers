    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper surveys the literature on privacy-preserving machine learning on graphs. We focus on the problem of training a machine learning model on a graph while preserving the privacy of the graph's nodes. We discuss the problem's motivation, the threat model, and the privacy guarantees that have been proposed. We then survey the literature on differentially private graph neural networks, federated graph learning, and secure multi-party computation for graph learning. We conclude with a discussion of open problems and future directions.</p>
