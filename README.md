    <p><b>Summary:</b> The notions of privacy tests and $k$-extendible states have both been
instrumental in quantum information theory, particularly in understanding the
limits of secure communication. In this paper, we determine the maximum
probability with which an arbitrary $k$-extendible state can pass a privacy
test, and we prove that it is equal to the maximum fidelity between an
arbitrary $k$-extendible state and the standard maximally entangled state. Our
findings, coupled with the resource theory of $k$-unextendibility, lead to an
efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable key of
a bipartite state, and we prove that it is equal to the best-known efficiently
computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable entanglement. We
also establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot,
forward-assisted private capacity of channels. Extending our formalism to the
independent and identically distributed setting, we obtain single-letter
efficiently computable bounds on the $n$-shot, one-way distillable key of a
state and the $n$-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of a channel. For
some key examples of interest, our bounds are significantly tighter than other
known efficiently computable bounds.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled
with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based
applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically
guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but
challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability,
and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a
novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the
theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method
adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity,
leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared
to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by
retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space
overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and
parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and
PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and
significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack
experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing
identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time
privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring,
driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural

data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and quantum computing is
redefining the security paradigm of interconnected digital systems. Classical
cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) have long provided the foundation for
securing IoT communication. However, the emergence of quantum algorithms such
as Shor's and Grover's threatens to render these techniques vulnerable,
necessitating the development of quantum-resilient alternatives. This chapter
examines the implications of quantum computing for IoT security and explores
strategies for building cryptographically robust systems in the post-quantum
era. It presents an overview of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) families,
including lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, and multivariate approaches,
analyzing their potential for deployment in resource-constrained IoT
environments. In addition, quantum-based methods such as Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are discussed
for their ability to enhance confidentiality and privacy through physics-based
security guarantees. The chapter also highlights issues of privacy management,
regulatory compliance, and standardization, emphasizing the need for
collaborative efforts across academia, industry, and governance. Overall, it
provides a comprehensive perspective on security IoT ecosystems against quantum
threats and ensures resilience in the next generation of intelligent networks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent advances in multi-modal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) have
demonstrated a powerful ability to synthesize implicit information from
disparate sources, including images and text. These resourceful data from
social media also introduce a significant and underexplored privacy risk: the
inference of sensitive personal attributes from seemingly daily media content.
However, the lack of benchmarks and comprehensive evaluations of
state-of-the-art M-LLM capabilities hinders the research of private attribute
profiling on social media. Accordingly, we propose (1) PRISM, the first
multi-modal, multi-dimensional and fine-grained synthesized dataset
incorporating a comprehensive privacy landscape and dynamic user history; (2)
an Efficient evaluation framework that measures the cross-modal privacy
inference capabilities of advanced M-LLM. Specifically, PRISM is a large-scale
synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate cross-modal privacy risks. Its key
feature is 12 sensitive attribute labels across a diverse set of multi-modal
profiles, which enables targeted privacy analysis. These profiles are generated
via a sophisticated LLM agentic workflow, governed by a prior distribution to
ensure they realistically mimic social media users. Additionally, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inference Framework that leverages a pipeline of specialized LLMs
to enhance evaluation capabilities. We evaluate the inference capabilities of
six leading M-LLMs (Qwen, Gemini, GPT-4o, GLM, Doubao, and Grok) on PRISM. The
comparison with human performance reveals that these MLLMs significantly
outperform in accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the threat of potential
privacy risks and the urgent need for robust defenses.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Wireless sensing technologies can now detect heartbeats using radio frequency
and acoustic signals, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy
solutions either protect from all sensing systems indiscriminately preventing
any utility or operate post-data collection, failing to enable selective access
where authorized devices can monitor while unauthorized ones cannot. We present
a key-based physical obfuscation system, PrivyWave, that addresses this
challenge by generating controlled decoy heartbeat signals at
cryptographically-determined frequencies. Unauthorized sensors receive a
mixture of real and decoy signals that are indistinguishable without the secret
key, while authorized sensors use the key to filter out decoys and recover
accurate measurements. Our evaluation with 13 participants demonstrates
effective protection across both sensing modalities: for mmWave radar,
unauthorized sensors show 21.3 BPM mean absolute error while authorized sensors
maintain a much smaller 5.8 BPM; for acoustic sensing, unauthorized error
increases to 42.0 BPM while authorized sensors achieve 9.7 BPM. The system
operates across multiple sensing modalities without per-modality customization
and provides cryptographic obfuscation guarantees. Performance benchmarks show
robust protection across different distances (30-150 cm), orientations
(120{\deg} field of view), and diverse indoor environments, establishing
physical-layer obfuscation as a viable approach for selective privacy in
pervasive health monitoring.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> There are no universally accepted definitions of R\'enyi conditional entropy
and R\'enyi mutual information, although motivated by different applications,
several definitions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we
consider a family of two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy and a family of
two-parameter R\'enyi mutual information. By performing a change of variables
for the parameters, the two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy we study
coincides precisely with the definition introduced by Hayashi and Tan [IEEE
Trans. Inf. Theory, 2016], and it also emerges naturally as the classical
specialization of the three-parameter quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy
recently put forward by Rubboli, Goodarzi, and Tomamichel [arXiv:2410.21976
(2024)]. We establish several fundamental properties of the two-parameter
R\'enyi conditional entropy, including monotonicity with respect to the
parameters and variational expression. The associated two-parameter R\'enyi
mutual information considered in this paper is new and it unifies three
commonly used variants of R\'enyi mutual information. For this quantity, we
prove several important properties, including the non-negativity, additivity,
data processing inequality, monotonicity with respect to the parameters,
variational expression, as well as convexity and concavity. Finally, we
demonstrate that these two-parameter R\'enyi information quantities can be used
to characterize the strong converse exponents in privacy amplification and soft
covering problems under R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha \in (0, \infty)$.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Motivated by the pervasive lack of privacy protection in existing distributed
nonconvex optimization methods, this paper proposes a decentralized proximal
primal-dual algorithm enabling double protection of privacy ($\text{DPP}^2$)
for minimizing nonconvex sum-utility functions over multi-agent networks, which
ensures zero leakage of critical local information during inter-agent
communications. We develop a two-tier privacy protection mechanism that first
merges the primal and dual variables by means of a variable transformation,
followed by embedding an additional random perturbation to further obfuscate
the transmitted information. We theoretically establish that $\text{DPP}^2$
ensures differential privacy for local objectives while achieving exact
convergence under nonconvex settings. Specifically, $\text{DPP}^2$ converges
sublinearly to a stationary point and attains a linear convergence rate under
the additional Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P-{\L}) condition. Finally, a numerical
example demonstrates the superiority of $\text{DPP}^2$ over a number of
state-of-the-art algorithms, showcasing the faster, exact convergence achieved
by $\text{DPP}^2$ under the same level of differential privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> When releasing binary proportions computed using sensitive data, several
government agencies and other data stewards protect confidentiality of the
underlying values by ensuring the released statistics satisfy differential
privacy. Typically, this is done by adding carefully chosen noise to the sample
proportion computed using the confidential data. In this article, we describe
and compare methods for turning this differentially private proportion into an
interval estimate for an underlying population probability. Specifically, we
consider differentially private versions of the Wald and Wilson intervals,
Bayesian credible intervals based on denoising the differentially private
proportion, and an exact interval motivated by the Clopper-Pearson confidence
interval. We examine the repeated sampling performances of the intervals using
simulation studies under both the Laplace mechanism and discrete Gaussian
mechanism across a range of privacy guarantees. We find that while several
methods can offer reasonable performances, the Bayesian credible intervals are
the most attractive.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have marked significant impact in traffic state
prediction, social recommendation, knowledge-aware question answering and so
on. As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a
critical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in
cloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs
need to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the
financial cost of cloud computing is another primary concern for users.
Therefore, although existing studies have proposed privacy-preserving
techniques for GNNs in cloud environments, their additional computational and
communication overhead remain relatively high, causing high financial costs
that limit their widespread adoption among users.
  To protect GNN privacy while lowering the additional financial costs, we
introduce Panther, a cost-effective privacy-preserving framework for GNN
training and inference services in cloud environments. Technically, Panther
leverages four-party computation to asynchronously executing the secure array
access protocol, and randomly pads the neighbor information of GNN nodes. We
prove that Panther can protect privacy for both training and inference of GNN
models. Our evaluation shows that Panther reduces the training and inference
time by an average of 75.28% and 82.80%, respectively, and communication
overhead by an average of 52.61% and 50.26% compared with the state-of-the-art,
which is estimated to save an average of 55.05% and 59.00% in financial costs
(based on on-demand pricing model) for the GNN training and inference process
on Google Cloud Platform.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's
interconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing,
and database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI)
detectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across
multiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized
learning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data
ownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing.
Compounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that
are both robust and adaptable.
  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL
platform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a
ransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure. This
paradigm is particularly relevant for cybersecurity companies (including both
software and hardware vendors) that deploy ransomware detection or firewall
systems across millions of endpoints. In such environments, data cannot be
transferred outside the customer's device due to strict security, privacy, or
regulatory constraints. Although FL applies broadly to malware threats, we
validate the approach using the Ransomware Storage Access Patterns (RanSAP)
dataset.
  Our experiments demonstrate that FL improves ransomware detection accuracy by
a relative 9% over server-local models and achieves performance comparable to
centralized training. These results indicate that FL offers a scalable,
high-performing, and privacy-preserving framework for proactive ransomware
detection across organizational and regulatory boundaries.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We develop a framework for quantum differential privacy (QDP) based on
quantum hypothesis testing and Blackwell's ordering. This approach
characterizes $(\eps,\delta)$-QDP via hypothesis testing divergences and
identifies the most informative quantum state pairs under privacy constraints.
We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum learning algorithms,
generalizing classical results to the case $\delta>0$. Additionally, we study
privatized quantum parameter estimation, deriving tight bounds on the quantum
Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction
bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the
hockey-stick divergence.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> To effectively manage the wastage of perishable fruits, it is crucial to
accurately predict their freshness or shelf life using non-invasive methods
that rely on visual data. In this regard, deep learning techniques can offer a
viable solution. However, obtaining fine-grained fruit freshness labels from
experts is costly, leading to a scarcity of data. Closed proprietary Vision
Language Models (VLMs), such as Gemini, have demonstrated strong performance in
fruit freshness detection task in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.
Nonetheless, food retail organizations are unable to utilize these proprietary
models due to concerns related to data privacy, while existing open-source VLMs
yield sub-optimal performance for the task. Fine-tuning these open-source
models with limited data fails to achieve the performance levels of proprietary
models. In this work, we introduce a Model-Agnostic Ordinal Meta-Learning
(MAOML) algorithm, designed to train smaller VLMs. This approach utilizes
meta-learning to address data sparsity and leverages label ordinality, thereby
achieving state-of-the-art performance in the fruit freshness classification
task under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method achieves an
industry-standard accuracy of 92.71%, averaged across all fruits.

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality synthesis of
specific subjects, such as identities or objects. This capability, while
unlocking new possibilities in content creation, also introduces significant
privacy risks, as personalization techniques can be misused by malicious users
to generate unauthorized content. Although several studies have attempted to
counter this by generating adversarially perturbed samples designed to disrupt
personalization, they rely on unrealistic assumptions and become ineffective in
the presence of even a few clean images or under simple image transformations.
To address these challenges, we shift the protection target from the images to
the diffusion model itself to hinder the personalization of specific subjects,
through our novel framework called Anti-Personalized Diffusion Models (APDM).
We first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a naive approach of
existing loss functions to diffusion models is inherently incapable of ensuring
convergence for robust anti-personalization. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce Direct Protective Optimization (DPO), a novel loss function that
effectively disrupts subject personalization in the target model without
compromising generative quality. Moreover, we propose a new dual-path
optimization strategy, coined Learning to Protect (L2P). By alternating between
personalization and protection paths, L2P simulates future personalization
trajectories and adaptively reinforces protection at each step. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in preventing unauthorized personalization. The

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Private large language model (LLM) inference based on cryptographic
primitives offers a promising path towards privacy-preserving deep learning.
However, existing frameworks only support dense LLMs like LLaMA-1 and struggle
to scale to mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures. The key challenge comes
from securely evaluating the dynamic routing mechanism in MoE layers, which may
reveal sensitive input information if not fully protected. In this paper, we
propose CryptoMoE, the first framework that enables private, efficient, and
accurate inference for MoE-based models. CryptoMoE balances expert loads to
protect expert routing information and proposes novel protocols for secure
expert dispatch and combine. CryptoMoE also develops a confidence-aware token
selection strategy and a batch matrix multiplication protocol to improve
accuracy and efficiency further. Extensive experiments on DeepSeekMoE-16.4B,
OLMoE-6.9B, and QWenMoE-14.3B show that CryptoMoE achieves $2.8\sim3.5\times$
end-to-end latency reduction and $2.9\sim4.3\times$ communication reduction
over a dense baseline with minimum accuracy loss. We also adapt CipherPrune
(ICLR'25) for MoE inference and demonstrate CryptoMoE can reduce the
communication by up to $4.3 \times$. Code is available at:

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple institutions to cooperatively train
machine learning models while retaining sensitive data at the source, which has
great utility in privacy-sensitive environments. However, FL systems remain
vulnerable to membership-inference attacks and data heterogeneity. This paper
presents FedOnco-Bench, a reproducible benchmark for privacy-aware FL using
synthetic oncologic CT scans with tumor annotations. It evaluates segmentation
performance and privacy leakage across FL methods: FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN, and
FedAvg with DP-SGD. Results show a distinct trade-off between privacy and
utility: FedAvg is high performance (Dice around 0.85) with more privacy
leakage (attack AUC about 0.72), while DP-SGD provides a higher level of
privacy (AUC around 0.25) at the cost of accuracy (Dice about 0.79). FedProx
and FedBN offer balanced performance under heterogeneous data, especially with
non-identical distributed client data. FedOnco-Bench serves as a standardized,
open-source platform for benchmarking and developing privacy-preserving FL

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While homomorphic encryption (HE) provides strong privacy protection, its
high computational cost has restricted its application to simple tasks.
Recently, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) applied to HE has shown promising
performance for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). However, when
applied to more realistic scenarios such as batch inference, the HDC-based HE
has still very high compute time as well as high encryption and data
transmission overheads. To address this problem, we propose HDC with encrypted
parameters (EP-HDC), which is a novel PPML approach featuring client-side HE,
i.e., inference is performed on a client using a homomorphically encrypted
model. Our EP-HDC can effectively mitigate the encryption and data transmission
overhead, as well as providing high scalability with many clients while
providing strong protection for user data and model parameters. In addition to
application examples for our client-side PPML, we also present design space
exploration involving quantization, architecture, and HE-related parameters.
Our experimental results using the BFV scheme and the Face/Emotion datasets
demonstrate that our method can improve throughput and latency of batch
inference by orders of magnitude over previous PPML methods (36.52~1068x and
6.45~733x, respectively) with less than 1% accuracy degradation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sharing sensitive time series data in domains such as finance, healthcare,
and energy consumption, such as patient records or investment accounts, is
often restricted due to privacy concerns. Privacy-aware synthetic time series
generation addresses this challenge by enforcing noise during training,
inherently introducing a trade-off between privacy and utility. In many cases,
sensitive sequences is correlated with publicly available, non-sensitive
contextual metadata (e.g., household electricity consumption may be influenced
by weather conditions and electricity prices). However, existing privacy-aware
data generation methods often overlook this opportunity, resulting in
suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs. In this paper, we present Pub2Priv, a
novel framework for generating private time series data by leveraging
heterogeneous public knowledge. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism to
encode public data into temporal and feature embeddings, which serve as
conditional inputs for a diffusion model to generate synthetic private
sequences. Additionally, we introduce a practical metric to assess privacy by
evaluating the identifiability of the synthetic data. Experimental results show
that Pub2Priv consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in improving
the privacy-utility trade-off across finance, energy, and commodity trading
domains.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent work in Differential Privacy with Natural Language Processing (DP NLP)
has proposed numerous promising techniques in the form of text rewriting
mechanisms. In the evaluation of these mechanisms, an often-ignored aspect is
that of dataset size, or rather, the effect of dataset size on a mechanism's
efficacy for utility and privacy preservation. In this work, we are the first
to introduce this factor in the evaluation of DP text privatization, where we
design utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets with dynamic split
sizes. We run these tests on datasets of varying size with up to one million
texts, and we focus on quantifying the effect of increasing dataset size on the
privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings reveal that dataset size plays an
integral part in evaluating DP text rewriting mechanisms; additionally, these

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The prevalent engagement with mobile apps underscores the importance of
understanding their data practices. Transparency plays a crucial role in this
context, ensuring users to be informed and give consent before any data access
occurs. Apple introduced a new feature since iOS 15.2, App Privacy Report, to
inform users about detailed insights into apps' data access and sharing. This
feature continues Apple's trend of privacy-focused innovations (following
Privacy Nutrition Labels), and has been marketed as a big step forward in user
privacy. However, its real-world impacts on user privacy and control remain
unexamined. We thus proposed an end-to-end study involving systematic
assessment of the App Privacy Report's real-world benefits and limitations,
LLM-enabled and multi-technique synthesized enhancements, and comprehensive
evaluation from both system and user perspectives. Through a structured focus
group study with twelve everyday iOS users, we explored their experiences,
understanding, and perceptions of the feature, suggesting its limited practical
impact resulting from missing important details. We identified two primary user
concerns: the clarity of data access purpose and domain description. In
response, we proposed enhancements including a purpose inference framework and
domain clarification pipeline. We demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits
of such enhancements for mobile app users. This work provides practical
insights that could help enhance user privacy transparency and discusses areas

    <p><b>Summary:</b> To discover new insights from data, there is a growing need to share
information that is often held by different organisations. One key task in data
integration is the calculation of similarities between records in different
databases to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same
real-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the
owners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or
share their data with other organisations to allow such similarity
calculations. Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of
matching records that refer to the same entity across sensitive databases held
by different organisations while ensuring no information about the entities is
revealed to the participating parties. In this paper, we study how embedding
based encoding techniques can be applied in the PPRL context to ensure the
privacy of the entities that are being linked. We first convert individual
q-grams into the embedded space and then convert the embedding of a set of
q-grams of a given record into a binary representation. The final binary
representations can be used to link records into matches and non-matches. We
empirically evaluate our proposed encoding technique against different
real-world datasets. The results suggest that our proposed encoding approach
can provide better linkage accuracy and protect the privacy of individuals
against attack compared to state-of-the-art techniques for short record values.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Accurate classification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture, enabling
applications such as crop monitoring, fruit recognition, and pest detection.
However, conventional centralized training often requires large-scale data
collection, which raises privacy concerns, while standard federated learning
struggles with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and
incurs high communication costs. To address these challenges, we propose a
federated learning framework that integrates a frozen Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vision transformer (ViT) with a lightweight
transformer classifier. By leveraging the strong feature extraction capability
of the pre-trained CLIP ViT, the framework avoids training large-scale models
from scratch and restricts federated updates to a compact classifier, thereby
reducing transmission overhead significantly. Furthermore, to mitigate
performance degradation caused by non-IID data distribution, a small subset
(1%) of CLIP-extracted feature representations from all classes is shared
across clients. These shared features are non-reversible to raw images,
ensuring privacy preservation while aligning class representation across
participants. Experimental results on agricultural classification tasks show
that the proposed method achieve 86.6% accuracy, which is more than 4 times
higher compared to baseline federated learning approaches. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of combining vision-language model features
with federated learning for privacy-preserving and scalable agricultural

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Recent improvement gains in large language models (LLMs) have lead to
everyday usage of AI-based Conversational Agents (CAs). At the same time, LLMs
are vulnerable to an array of threats, including jailbreaks and, for example,
causing remote code execution when fed specific inputs. As a result, users may
unintentionally introduce risks, for example, by uploading malicious files or
disclosing sensitive information. However, the extent to which such user
behaviors occur and thus potentially facilitate exploits remains largely
unclear. To shed light on this issue, we surveyed a representative sample of
3,270 UK adults in 2024 using Prolific. A third of these use CA services such
as ChatGPT or Gemini at least once a week. Of these ``regular users'', up to a
third exhibited behaviors that may enable attacks, and a fourth have tried
jailbreaking (often out of understandable reasons such as curiosity, fun or
information seeking). Half state that they sanitize data and most participants
report not sharing sensitive data. However, few share very sensitive data such
as passwords. The majority are unaware that their data can be used to train
models and that they can opt-out. Our findings suggest that current academic
threat models manifest in the wild, and mitigations or guidelines for the
secure usage of CAs should be developed. In areas critical to security and
privacy, CAs must be equipped with effective AI guardrails to prevent, for
example, revealing sensitive information to curious employees. Vendors need to
increase efforts to prevent the entry of sensitive data, and to create
transparency with regard to data usage policies and settings.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Smart home devices such as video doorbells and security cameras are becoming
increasingly common in everyday life. While these devices offer convenience and
safety, they also raise new privacy concerns: how these devices affect others,
like neighbors, visitors, or people passing by. This issue is generally known
as interdependent privacy, where one person's actions (or inaction) may impact
the privacy of others, and, specifically, bystander privacy in the context of
smart homes. Given lax data protection regulations in terms of shared physical
spaces and amateur joint data controllers, we expect that the privacy policies
of smart home products reflect the missing regulatory incentives. This paper
presents a focused privacy policy analysis of 20 video doorbell and smart
camera products, concentrating explicitly on the bystander aspect. We show that
although some of the vendors acknowledge bystanders, they address it only to
the extent of including disclaimers, shifting the ethical responsibility for
collecting the data of non-users to the device owner. In addition, we identify
and examine real-world cases related to bystander privacy, demonstrating how
current deployments can impact non-users. Based on our findings, we analyze
vendor privacy policies in light of existing legal frameworks and technical
capabilities, and we provide practical recommendations for both policy language
and system design to enhance transparency and empower both bystanders and
device owners.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a widely adopted privacy-protection model
in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and
scalable nature. However, it is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and existing
defenses either incur prohibitive resource overheads or rely on domain-specific
prior knowledge, limiting their practical deployment. To address these
limitations, we propose PEEL, a Poisoning-Exposing Encoding theoretical
framework for LDP, which departs from resource- or prior-dependent
countermeasures and instead leverages the inherent structural consistency of
LDP-perturbed data. As a non-intrusive post-processing module, PEEL amplifies
stealthy poisoning effects by re-encoding LDP-perturbed data via
sparsification, normalization, and low-rank projection, thereby revealing both
output and rule poisoning attacks through structural inconsistencies in the
reconstructed space. Theoretical analysis proves that PEEL, integrated with
LDP, retains unbiasedness and statistical accuracy, while being robust to
expose both output and rule poisoning attacks. Moreover, evaluation results
show that LDP-integrated PEEL not only outperforms four state-of-the-art
defenses in terms of poisoning exposure accuracy but also significantly reduces
client-side computational costs, making it highly suitable for large-scale IoT
deployments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Traditional centralized scholarship evaluation processes typically require
students to submit detailed academic records and qualification information,
which exposes them to risks of data leakage and misuse, making it difficult to
simultaneously ensure privacy protection and transparent auditability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a scholarship evaluation system
based on Decentralized Identity (DID) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). The
system aggregates multidimensional ZKPs off-chain, and smart contracts verify
compliance with evaluation criteria without revealing raw scores or

solution not only automates the evaluation efficiently but also maximally
preserves student privacy and data integrity, offering a practical and
trustworthy technical paradigm for higher education scholarship programs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The integration of clinical data offers significant potential for the
development of personalized medicine. However, its use is severely restricted
by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts
with rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the
development of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel,
multi-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a
simulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to
represent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any
sensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC)
federated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client
configuration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes
place within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct
supervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by
the hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only
return aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance
feedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the
clinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a
cKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context
of real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated
during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner
Children's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient
classification and diagnosis without access to real data. Deploying secure
algorithms via federated frameworks, such as the FC framework, could be a
practical way of achieving privacy-preserving AI in healthcare.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy concerns have become increasingly critical in modern AI and data
science applications, where sensitive information is collected, analyzed, and
shared across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobility. While
prior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many
real-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,
where the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential
disclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across
releases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains
hidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an
attacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting
dependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual
release satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel
attack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a
Hidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional
inference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and
later observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate
our framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary
can recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive
experiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model
consistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release
independently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to
sequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can
collectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally. These
findings underscore the need for new privacy-preserving frameworks that
explicitly model temporal dependencies, such as time-aware differential privacy
or sequential data obfuscation strategies.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> While semantic communication (SemCom) improves transmission efficiency by
focusing on task-relevant information, it also raises critical privacy
concerns. Many existing secure SemCom approaches rely on restrictive or
impractical assumptions, such as favorable channel conditions for the
legitimate user or prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's model. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure SemCom framework for
image transmission over wiretap channels, leveraging differential privacy (DP)
to provide approximate privacy guarantees. Specifically, our approach first
extracts disentangled semantic representations from source images using
generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion method, and then selectively
perturbs private semantic representations with approximate DP noise. Distinct
from conventional DP-based protection methods, we introduce DP noise with
learnable pattern, instead of traditional white Gaussian or Laplace noise,
achieved through adversarial training of neural networks (NNs). This design
mitigates the inherent non-invertibility of DP while effectively protecting
private information. Moreover, it enables explicitly controllable security
levels by adjusting the privacy budget according to specific security
requirements, which is not achieved in most existing secure SemCom approaches.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the previous DP-based
method and direct transmission, the proposed method significantly degrades the
reconstruction quality for the eavesdropper, while introducing only slight
degradation in task performance. Under comparable security levels, our approach
achieves an LPIPS advantage of 0.06-0.29 and an FPPSR advantage of 0.10-0.86
for the legitimate user compared with the previous DP-based method.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Virtual Reality (VR) has gained increasing traction among various domains in
recent years, with major companies such as Meta, Pico, and Microsoft launching
their application stores to support third-party developers in releasing their
applications (or simply apps). These apps offer rich functionality but
inherently collect privacy-sensitive data, such as user biometrics, behaviors,
and the surrounding environment. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of
domain-specific regulations to govern the data handling of VR apps, resulting
in significant variations in their privacy practices among app stores.
  In this work, we present the first comprehensive multi-store study of privacy
practices in the current VR app ecosystem, covering a large-scale dataset
involving 6,565 apps collected from five major app stores. We assess both
declarative and behavioral privacy practices of VR apps, using a multi-faceted
approach based on natural language processing, reverse engineering, and static
analysis. Our assessment reveals significant privacy compliance issues across
all stores, underscoring the premature status of privacy protection in this
rapidly growing ecosystem. For instance, one third of apps fail to declare
their use of sensitive data, and 21.5\% of apps neglect to provide valid
privacy policies. Our work sheds light on the status quo of privacy protection
within the VR app ecosystem for the first time. Our findings should raise an
alert to VR app developers and users, and encourage store operators to
implement stringent regulations on privacy compliance among VR apps.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep neural networks can convert ECG page images into analyzable waveforms,
yet centralized training often conflicts with cross-institutional privacy and
deployment constraints. A cross-silo federated digitization framework is
presented that trains a full-model nnU-Net segmentation backbone without
sharing images and aggregates updates across sites under realistic non-IID
heterogeneity (layout, grid style, scanner profile, noise).
  The protocol integrates three standard server-side aggregators--FedAvg,
FedProx, and FedAdam--and couples secure aggregation with central, user-level
differential privacy to align utility with formal guarantees. Key features
include: (i) end-to-end full-model training and synchronization across clients;
(ii) secure aggregation so the server only observes a clipped, weighted sum
once a participation threshold is met; (iii) central Gaussian DP with Renyi
accounting applied post-aggregation for auditable user-level privacy; and (iv)
a calibration-aware digitization pipeline comprising page normalization, trace
segmentation, grid-leakage suppression, and vectorization to twelve-lead
signals.
  Experiments on ECG pages rendered from PTB-XL show consistently faster
convergence and higher late-round plateaus with adaptive server updates
(FedAdam) relative to FedAvg and FedProx, while approaching centralized
performance. The privacy mechanism maintains competitive accuracy while
preventing exposure of raw images or per-client updates, yielding deployable,
auditable guarantees suitable for multi-institution settings.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across
various tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related
to intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks,
where adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services.
These attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats
to revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking
solution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model
traceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study
the vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\delta$-STEAL, a
novel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark
detectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\delta$-STEAL
injects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during
fine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP)
guarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect
outputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise
to these pairs, $\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it
difficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used,
thereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that
$\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of
up to $96.95\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model
utility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack
effectiveness and model utility. This poses a significant risk, as even robust
watermarks can be bypassed, allowing adversaries to deceive watermark detectors
and undermine current intellectual property protection methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium
(NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely
employed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional
knowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for
correlated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise
maximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By
incorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a
precise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In
the entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy
guarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the
individual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper
bound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize
that PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to
adequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct
experiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information
to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Previous studies on PTA have focused on analyzing privacy threats based on
the potential areas of occurrence and their likelihood of occurrence. However,
an in-depth understanding of the threat actors involved, their actions, and the
intentions that result in privacy threats is essential. In this paper, we
present a novel Privacy Threat Model Framework (PTMF) that analyzes privacy
threats through different phases.
  The PTMF development is motivated through the selected tactics from the MITRE
ATT\&CK framework and techniques from the LINDDUN privacy threat model, making
PTMF a privacy-centered framework. The proposed PTMF can be employed in various
ways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy
threats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this
paper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by
developing a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both
industry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their
opinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat
actors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11
privacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the
critical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining
11 privacy threats. This study could provide a solid foundation for
understanding how and where privacy measures can be proactively and effectively
deployed in IoT systems to mitigate privacy threats based on the activities and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> There are increasing risks of privacy disclosure when sharing the automotive
location data in particular functions such as route navigation, driving
monitoring and vehicle scheduling. These risks could lead to the attacks
including user behavior recognition, sensitive location inference and
trajectory reconstruction. In order to mitigate the data security risk caused
by the automotive location sharing, this paper proposes a high-precision
privacy protection mechanism based on format-preserving encryption (FPE) of
geographical coordinates. The automotive coordinate data key mapping mechanism
is designed to reduce to the accuracy loss of the geographical location data
caused by the repeated encryption and decryption. The experimental results
demonstrate that the average relative distance retention rate (RDR) reached
0.0844, and the number of hotspots in the critical area decreased by 98.9%
after encryption. To evaluate the accuracy loss of the proposed encryption
algorithm on automotive geographical location data, this paper presents the
experimental analysis of decryption accuracy, and the result indicates that the
decrypted coordinate data achieves a restoration accuracy of 100%. This work
presents a high-precision privacy protection method for automotive location
data, thereby providing an efficient data security solution for the sensitive
data sharing in autonomous driving.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is an emerging topic to handle
secure machine learning inference over sensitive data in untrusted
environments. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation directly
on encrypted data on the server side, making it a promising approach for PPML.
However, it introduces significant communication and computation overhead on
the client side, making it impractical for edge devices. Hybrid homomorphic
encryption (HHE) addresses this limitation by combining symmetric encryption
(SE) with FHE to reduce the computational cost on the client side, and
combining with an FHE-friendly SE can also lessen the processing overhead on
the server side, making it a more balanced and efficient alternative. Our work
proposes a hardware-accelerated HHE architecture built around a lightweight
symmetric cipher optimized for FHE compatibility and implemented as a dedicated
hardware accelerator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design to
integrate an end-to-end HHE framework with hardware acceleration. Beyond this,
we also present several microarchitectural optimizations to achieve higher
performance and energy efficiency. The proposed work is integrated into a full
PPML pipeline, enabling secure inference with significantly lower latency and
power consumption than software implementations. Our contributions validate the
feasibility of low-power, hardware- accelerated HHE for edge deployment and
provide a hardware- software co-design methodology for building scalable,
secure machine learning systems in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on a PYNQ-Z2 platform with the MNIST dataset show over a 50x
reduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly a 2x gain in hardware
throughput compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.</p>

traditional paper-based agreements remain a bottleneck for automation,

ambiguity, require manual processing, and lack computational verifiability, all
of which hinder efficient digital commerce. Computable legal contracts,
expressed in machine-readable formats, offer a potential solution by enabling
automated execution and verification. Blockchain-based smart contracts further
strengthen enforceability and accelerate dispute resolution; however, current
implementations risk exposing sensitive agreement terms on public ledgers,
raising serious privacy and competitive intelligence concerns that limit
enterprise adoption.
  We introduce zk-agreements, a protocol designed to transition from
paper-based trust to cryptographic trust while preserving confidentiality. Our
design combines zero-knowledge proofs to protect private agreement terms,
secure two-party computation to enable private compliance evaluation, and smart

achieve both privacy preservation and computational enforceability, resolving

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile and
edge platforms, securing them against model extraction attacks has become a
pressing concern. However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the
performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a
challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance
execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a
heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate
privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to
untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts
an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy:
security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of
attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an
SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are
performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the
enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and
evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that
SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance,
offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Deep learning is widely applied to modern problems through neural networks,
but the growing computational and energy demands of these models have driven
interest in more efficient approaches. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the
third generation of neural networks, mimic the brain's event-driven behaviour,
offering improved performance and reduced power use. At the same time, concerns
about data privacy during cloud-based model execution have led to the adoption
of cryptographic methods. This article introduces BioEncryptSNN, a spiking
neural network based encryption-decryption framework for secure and
noise-resilient data protection. Unlike conventional algorithms, BioEncryptSNN
converts ciphertext into spike trains and exploits temporal neural dynamics to
model encryption and decryption, optimising parameters such as key length,
spike timing, and synaptic connectivity. Benchmarked against AES-128, RSA-2048,
and DES, BioEncryptSNN preserved data integrity while achieving up to 4.1x
faster encryption and decryption than PyCryptodome's AES implementation. The
framework demonstrates scalability and adaptability across symmetric and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In recent years, the rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
into the healthcare sector has brought about revolutionary advancements in
patient care and data management. While these technological innovations hold
immense promise, they concurrently raise critical security concerns,
particularly in safeguarding medical data against potential cyber threats. The
sensitive nature of health-related information requires robust measures to

Blockchain-Enabled Request and Transaction Encryption to strengthen data
transaction security, providing an immutable and transparent framework. In the
second phase, we introduce a Request Pattern Recognition Check that leverages
diverse data sources to identify and block potential unauthorized access
attempts. Finally, the third phase incorporates Feature Selection and a BiLSTM
network to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection using
advanced machine learning techniques. We compared the simulation results of the
proposed method with three recent related methods: AIBPSF-IoMT, OMLIDS-PBIoT,
and AIMMFIDS. The evaluation criteria include detection rate, false alarm rate,
precision, recall, and accuracy - crucial benchmarks for assessing the overall
performance of intrusion detection systems. Our findings show that the proposed

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare has
revolutionized patient care by enabling real-time monitoring, personalized
treatments, and efficient data management. However, this technological
advancement introduces significant security risks, particularly concerning the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive medical data.
Traditional security measures are often insufficient to address the unique
challenges posed by IoT environments, such as heterogeneity, resource
constraints, and the need for real-time processing. To tackle these challenges,
we propose a comprehensive three-phase security framework designed to enhance
the security and reliability of IoT-enabled healthcare systems. In the first
phase, the framework assesses the reliability of IoT devices using a
reputation-based trust estimation mechanism, which combines device behavior
analytics with off-chain data storage to ensure scalability. The second phase
integrates blockchain technology with a lightweight proof-of-work mechanism,
ensuring data immutability, secure communication, and resistance to
unauthorized access. The third phase employs a lightweight Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model for anomaly detection and classification, enabling
real-time identification of cyber threats. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed framework outperforms existing methods, achieving a 2% increase in
precision, accuracy, and recall, a 5% higher attack detection rate, and a 3%
reduction in false alarm rate. These improvements highlight the framework's
ability to address critical security concerns while maintaining scalability and
real-time performance.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Phone scams remain a pervasive threat to both personal safety and financial
security worldwide. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong potential in detecting fraudulent behavior by analyzing
transcribed phone conversations. However, these capabilities introduce notable
privacy risks, as such conversations frequently contain sensitive personal
information that may be exposed to third-party service providers during
processing. In this work, we explore how to harness LLMs for phone scam
detection while preserving user privacy. We propose MASK (Modular Adaptive
Sanitization Kit), a trainable and extensible framework that enables dynamic
privacy adjustment based on individual preferences. MASK provides a pluggable
architecture that accommodates diverse sanitization methods - from traditional
keyword-based techniques for high-privacy users to sophisticated neural
approaches for those prioritizing accuracy. We also discuss potential modeling
approaches and loss function designs for future development, enabling the
creation of truly personalized, privacy-aware LLM-based detection systems that
balance user trust and detection effectiveness, even beyond phone scam context.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> We initiate the study of distribution testing under \emph{user-level} local
differential privacy, where each of $n$ users contributes $m$ samples from the
unknown underlying distribution. This setting, albeit very natural, is
significantly more challenging that the usual locally private setting, as for
the same parameter $\varepsilon$ the privacy guarantee must now apply to a full
batch of $m$ data points. While some recent work consider distribution
\emph{learning} in this user-level setting, nothing was known for even the most
fundamental testing task, uniformity testing (and its generalization, identity
testing).
  We address this gap, by providing (nearly) sample-optimal user-level LDP
algorithms for uniformity and identity testing. Motivated by practical
considerations, our main focus is on the private-coin, symmetric setting, which
does not require users to share a common random seed nor to have been assigned
a globally unique identifier.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Evaluating the relevance of data is a critical task for model builders
seeking to acquire datasets that enhance model performance. Ideally, such
evaluation should allow the model builder to assess the utility of candidate
data without exposing proprietary details of the model. At the same time, data
providers must be assured that no information about their data - beyond the
computed utility score - is disclosed to the model builder.
  In this paper, we present PrivaDE, a cryptographic protocol for
privacy-preserving utility scoring and selection of data for machine learning.
While prior works have proposed data evaluation protocols, our approach
advances the state of the art through a practical, blockchain-centric design.
Leveraging the trustless nature of blockchains, PrivaDE enforces
malicious-security guarantees and ensures strong privacy protection for both
models and datasets. To achieve efficiency, we integrate several techniques -
including model distillation, model splitting, and cut-and-choose
zero-knowledge proofs - bringing the runtime to a practical level. Furthermore,
we propose a unified utility scoring function that combines empirical loss,
predictive entropy, and feature-space diversity, and that can be seamlessly
integrated into active-learning workflows. Evaluation shows that PrivaDE
performs data evaluation effectively, achieving online runtimes within 15
minutes even for models with millions of parameters.
  Our work lays the foundation for fair and automated data marketplaces in
decentralized machine learning ecosystems.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms are deployed in data-sensitive
applications, such as adaptive clinical trials or user studies. Driven by the
privacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of
fixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli
distributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in
the non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and
upper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small
multiplicative constant, for any privacy budget $\epsilon$. First, we provide a
tighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any $\delta$-correct
and $\epsilon$-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the
non-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that
optimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance
scaled by $\epsilon$. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these
transportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an
arm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our
stopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the
Laplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions.
Third, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs.
For any budget $\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected
sample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant
smaller than $8$. Our algorithm outperforms existing $\delta$-correct and
$\epsilon$-global DP BAI algorithms for different values of $\epsilon$.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Striking a balance between protecting data privacy and enabling collaborative
computation is a critical challenge for distributed machine learning. While
privacy-preserving techniques for federated learning have been extensively
developed, methods for scenarios involving bitwise operations, such as
tree-based vertical federated learning (VFL), are still underexplored.
Traditional mechanisms, including Shamir's secret sharing and multi-party
computation (MPC), are not optimized for bitwise operations over binary data,
particularly in settings where each participant holds a different part of the
binary vector. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by
proposing a novel binary multi-party computation (BiMPC) framework. The BiMPC
mechanism facilitates privacy-preserving bitwise operations, with a particular
focus on dot product computations of binary vectors, ensuring the privacy of
each individual bit. The core of BiMPC is a novel approach called Dot Product
via Modular Addition (DoMA), which uses regular and modular additions for
efficient binary dot product calculation. To ensure privacy, BiMPC uses random
masking in a higher field for linear computations and a three-party oblivious
transfer (triot) protocol for non-linear binary operations. The privacy
guarantees of the BiMPC framework are rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its
efficiency and scalability in distributed settings.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A core challenge for autonomous LLM agents in collaborative settings is
balancing robust privacy understanding and preservation alongside task
efficacy. Existing privacy benchmarks only focus on simplistic, single-turn
interactions where private information can be trivially omitted without
affecting task outcomes. In this paper, we introduce MAGPIE (Multi-AGent
contextual PrIvacy Evaluation), a novel benchmark of 200 high-stakes tasks
designed to evaluate privacy understanding and preservation in multi-agent
collaborative, non-adversarial scenarios. MAGPIE integrates private information
as essential for task resolution, forcing agents to balance effective
collaboration with strategic information control. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art agents, including GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-Pro, exhibit
significant privacy leakage, with Gemini 2.5-Pro leaking up to 50.7% and GPT-5
up to 35.1% of the sensitive information even when explicitly instructed not
to. Moreover, these agents struggle to achieve consensus or task completion and
often resort to undesirable behaviors such as manipulation and power-seeking
(e.g., Gemini 2.5-Pro demonstrating manipulation in 38.2% of the cases). These
findings underscore that current LLM agents lack robust privacy understanding
and are not yet adequately aligned to simultaneously preserve privacy and

    <p><b>Summary:</b> With the exponential growth in mobile applications, protecting user privacy
has become even more crucial. Android applications are often known for
collecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts,
location, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or
awareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of
privacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying
data usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied
on formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these
techniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint
explosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis
methods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility
and scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we
propose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM
reasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and
explainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves
a significant F\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs
on the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid
and Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules
or sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides

    <p><b>Summary:</b> When users submit queries to Large Language Models (LLMs), their prompts can
often contain sensitive data, forcing a difficult choice: Send the query to a
powerful proprietary LLM providers to achieving state-of-the-art performance
and risk data exposure, or relying on smaller, local models guarantees data
privacy but often results in a degradation of task performance. Prior
approaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which
shatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive
information, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge
(Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and
introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to
solve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks,
learning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage
and task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and
task-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal
utility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a
new medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity
of learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one of the most
widely used methods for addressing class imbalance and generating synthetic
data. Despite its popularity, little attention has been paid to its privacy
implications; yet, it is used in the wild in many privacy-sensitive
applications. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of privacy
leakage in SMOTE: We begin by showing that prevailing evaluation practices,
i.e., naive distinguishing and distance-to-closest-record metrics, completely
fail to detect any leakage and that membership inference attacks (MIAs) can be
instantiated with high accuracy. Then, by exploiting SMOTE's geometric
properties, we build two novel attacks with very limited assumptions:
DistinSMOTE, which perfectly distinguishes real from synthetic records in
augmented datasets, and ReconSMOTE, which reconstructs real minority records
from synthetic datasets with perfect precision and recall approaching one under
realistic imbalance ratios. We also provide theoretical guarantees for both
attacks. Experiments on eight standard imbalanced datasets confirm the
practicality and effectiveness of these attacks. Overall, our work reveals that
SMOTE is inherently non-private and disproportionately exposes minority
records, highlighting the need to reconsider its use in privacy-sensitive
applications.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> To preserve privacy, multi-party computation (MPC) enables executing Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms on secret-shared or encrypted data. However, existing
MPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable
for ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or
genomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse
data, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to
prohibitively large memory requirements.
  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC
algorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms
avoid the memory issues of the "dense" data representation of classic secure
matrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can
significantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000)
for realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications
in which existing protocols are impractical.
  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can
be made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece
of information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is
small. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there
is a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row. This often
doesn't align with statistical reality, in a lot of sparse datasets the amount
of data per instance satisfies a power law. We propose an approach which allows
adopting a safe upper bound on the distribution of non-zeros in rows/columns of
sparse matrices.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.</p>

significant progress has been made in public blockchain interoperability,
bridging permissioned and permissionless blockchains poses unique challenges

This paper introduces a blockchain-agnostic framework to enable
interoperability between permissioned and permissionless networks. Leveraging
cryptographic techniques, the framework ensures secure data exchanges. Its
lightweight architectural design simplifies implementation and maintenance,
while the integration of Clover and Dandelion++ protocols enhances transaction

exposing sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, numerous query
sanitization systems have been developed, employing diverse approaches that
create a complex landscape for both researchers and practitioners. These
systems vary fundamentally in their design, including the underlying privacy

whether at the tuple- or user-level; and the software architecture, which can
be proxy-based or integrated. This paper provides a systematic classification
of state-of-the-art SQL sanitization systems based on these qualitative
criteria and the scope of queries they support. Furthermore, we present a
quantitative analysis of leading systems, empirically measuring the trade-offs
between data utility, query execution overhead, and privacy guarantees across a

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Federated learning (FL) enables organizations to collaboratively train models
without sharing their datasets. Despite this advantage, recent studies show
that both client updates and the global model can leak private information,
limiting adoption in sensitive domains such as healthcare. Local differential
privacy (LDP) offers strong protection by letting each participant privatize
updates before transmission. However, existing LDP methods were designed for
centralized training and introduce challenges in FL, including high resource
demands that can cause client dropouts and the lack of reliable privacy
guarantees under asynchronous participation. These issues undermine model
generalizability, fairness, and compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and
GDPR. To address them, we propose L-RDP, a DP method designed for LDP that
ensures constant, lower memory usage to reduce dropouts and provides rigorous
per-client privacy guarantees by accounting for intermittent participation.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a
speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as
the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in
isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone
calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are
available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple
utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's
vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their
voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content
anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the
transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while
preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation
setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on
voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based
anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.
Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against
content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure
anonymity in long-form audio.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b> Jieming Ke, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem
with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information.
Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed
estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's
privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication
costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher
information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher
information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive
information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in
privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a
multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits
only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally,
the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is
not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and
reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge
almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a
co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A
polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off
between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples
demonstrate the main results.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Cross chain interoperability in blockchain systems exposes a fundamental
tension between user privacy and regulatory accountability. Existing solutions
enforce an all or nothing choice between full anonymity and mandatory identity
disclosure, which limits adoption in regulated financial settings. We present
VeilAudit, a cross chain auditing framework that introduces Auditor Only
Linkability, which allows auditors to link transaction behaviors that originate
from the same anonymous entity without learning its identity. VeilAudit
achieves this with a user generated Linkable Audit Tag that embeds a zero
knowledge proof to attest to its validity without exposing the user master
wallet address, and with a special ciphertext that only designated auditors can
test for linkage. To balance privacy and compliance, VeilAudit also supports
threshold gated identity revelation under due process. VeilAudit further
provides a mechanism for building reputation in pseudonymous environments,
which enables applications such as cross chain credit scoring based on
verifiable behavioral history. We formalize the security guarantees and develop
a prototype that spans multiple EVM chains. Our evaluation shows that the
framework is practical for today multichain environments.</p>

release DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP

simultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection
not previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the
static setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\log

complexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce
graph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier
subsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space
incurred by prior work [ELMZ25]. We believe this simple idea may be of

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and
heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare
systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional
wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the
stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,
and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In
the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions
and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.
Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and
communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This
semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical
relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the
transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the
robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track
patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and
reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming
matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and
power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic
secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC
framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission
efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint
sensing and communication methods.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and
statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly
empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is
kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate
protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur
unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.
Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with
deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On
the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for
small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.
In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes
necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility
preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we
argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust
privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic
k-anonymity.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Local Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses significant privacy concerns in
sensitive data collection. In this work, we focus on numerical data collection
under LDP, targeting a significant gap in the literature: existing LDP
mechanisms are optimized for either a very small ($|\Omega| \in \{2, 3\}$) or
infinite output spaces. However, no generalized method for constructing an
optimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists. To fill this gap, we
propose the \textbf{N-output mechanism}, a generalized framework that maps
numerical data to one of $N$ discrete outputs.
  We formulate the mechanism's design as an optimization problem to minimize
estimation variance for any given $N \geq 2$ and develop both numerical and
analytical solutions. This results in a mechanism that is highly accurate and
adaptive, as its design is determined by solving an optimization problem for
any chosen $N$. Furthermore, we extend our framework and existing mechanisms to
the task of distribution estimation. Empirical evaluations show that the
N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and
distribution estimation with small communication costs.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mental health
contexts, from structured therapeutic support tools to informal chat-based
well-being assistants. While these systems increase accessibility, scalability,
and personalization, their integration into mental health care brings privacy
and safety challenges that have not been well-examined. Unlike traditional
clinical interactions, LLM-mediated therapy often lacks a clear structure for
what information is collected, how it is processed, and how it is stored or
reused. Users without clinical guidance may over-disclose personal information,
which is sometimes irrelevant to their presenting concern, due to misplaced
trust, lack of awareness of data risks, or the conversational design of the
system. This overexposure raises privacy concerns and also increases the
potential for LLM bias, misinterpretation, and long-term data misuse. We
propose a framework embedding Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy
interventions directly into mental health conversational systems, and outline a
study plan to evaluate their impact on disclosure safety, trust, and user
experience.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Since being proposed in 2006, differential privacy has become a standard
method for quantifying certain risks in publishing or sharing analyses of
sensitive data. At its heart, differential privacy measures risk in terms of
the differences between probability distributions, which is a central topic in
information theory. A differentially private algorithm is a channel between the
underlying data and the output of the analysis. Seen in this way, the
guarantees made by differential privacy can be understood in terms of
properties of this channel. In this article we examine a few of the key
connections between information theory and the formulation/application of
differential privacy, giving an ``operational significance'' for relevant
information measures.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications
spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal
information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security
and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different
privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to
protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These
frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational
efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability.
Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for
specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for
privacy and security application developers.
  We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in
selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application
scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML
frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It
supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering
parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or
federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption.
Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization
problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We
evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its
ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.</p>
