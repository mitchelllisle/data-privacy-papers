    "title" : "Evaluating the Effects of Digital Privacy Regulations on User Trust",
    "summary" : "In today's digital society, issues related to digital privacy have become\nincreasingly important. Issues such as data breaches result in misuse of data,\nfinancial loss, and cyberbullying, which leads to less user trust in digital\nservices. This research investigates the impact of digital privacy laws on user\ntrust by comparing the regulations in the Netherlands, Ghana, and Malaysia. The\nstudy employs a comparative case study method, involving interviews with\ndigital privacy law experts, IT educators, and consumers from each country. The\nmain findings reveal that while the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nin the Netherlands is strict, its practical impact is limited by enforcement\nchallenges. In Ghana, the Data Protection Act is underutilized due to low\npublic awareness and insufficient enforcement, leading to reliance on personal\nprotective measures. In Malaysia, trust in digital services is largely\ndependent on the security practices of individual platforms rather than the\nPersonal Data Protection Act. The study highlights the importance of public\nawareness, effective enforcement, and cultural considerations in shaping the\neffectiveness of digital privacy laws. Based on these insights, a\nrecommendation framework is proposed to enhance digital privacy practices, also\naiming to provide valuable guidance for policymakers, businesses, and citizens\nin navigating the challenges of digitalization.",

    "title" : "Learning Privacy-Preserving Student Networks via\n  Discriminative-Generative Distillation",
    "summary" : "While deep models have proved successful in learning rich knowledge from\nmassive well-annotated data, they may pose a privacy leakage risk in practical\ndeployment. It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility\nand strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative\ndistillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is\ntaking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then\ntransfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative\nstream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers\non multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream\ntakes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a\ndata-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive\nsynthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder\n(VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher\nensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of\nthem are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data.\nFinally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously\nhandle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few\nprivately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal\nadversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In\nthis way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate\naccuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving\nstudent model. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly show the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "title" : "How Privacy-Savvy Are Large Language Models? A Case Study on Compliance\n  and Privacy Technical Review",
    "summary" : "The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nexpanded their applications across various fields such as language generation,\nsummarization, and complex question answering. However, their application to\nprivacy compliance and technical privacy reviews remains under-explored,\nraising critical concerns about their ability to adhere to global privacy\nstandards and protect sensitive user data. This paper seeks to address this gap\nby providing a comprehensive case study evaluating LLMs' performance in\nprivacy-related tasks such as privacy information extraction (PIE), legal and\nregulatory key point detection (KPD), and question answering (QA) with respect\nto privacy policies and data protection regulations. We introduce a Privacy\nTechnical Review (PTR) framework, highlighting its role in mitigating privacy\nrisks during the software development life-cycle. Through an empirical\nassessment, we investigate the capacity of several prominent LLMs, including\nBERT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and custom models, in executing privacy compliance checks\nand technical privacy reviews. Our experiments benchmark the models across\nmultiple dimensions, focusing on their precision, recall, and F1-scores in\nextracting privacy-sensitive information and detecting key regulatory\ncompliance points. While LLMs show promise in automating privacy reviews and\nidentifying regulatory discrepancies, significant gaps persist in their ability\nto fully comply with evolving legal standards. We provide actionable\nrecommendations for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in privacy compliance,\nemphasizing the need for robust model improvements and better integration with\nlegal and regulatory requirements. This study underscores the growing\nimportance of developing privacy-aware LLMs that can both support businesses in\ncompliance efforts and safeguard user privacy rights.",

With the help of deep learning, decoding visual information from\nhuman brain activity fMRI has achieved promising performance. However, these\ndecoding models require centralized storage of fMRI data to conduct training,\nleading to potential privacy security issues. In this paper, we focus on\nprivacy preservation in multi-individual brain visual decoding. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel framework called FedMinds, which utilizes federated learning\nto protect individuals' privacy during model training. In addition, we deploy\nindividual adapters for each subject, thus allowing personalized visual\ndecoding.

    "summary" : "As network services progress and mobile and IoT environments expand, numerous\nsecurity concerns have surfaced for spectrum access systems. The omnipresent\nrisk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and raising concerns about user privacy\n(e.g., location privacy, anonymity) are among such cyber threats. These\nsecurity and privacy risks increase due to the threat of quantum computers that\ncan compromise long-term security by circumventing conventional cryptosystems\nand increasing the cost of countermeasures. While some defense mechanisms exist\nagainst these threats in isolation, there is a significant gap in the state of\nthe art on a holistic solution against DoS attacks with privacy and anonymity\nfor spectrum management systems, especially when post-quantum (PQ) security is\nin mind. In this paper, we propose a new cybersecurity framework PACDoSQ, which\nis (to the best of our knowledge) the first to offer location privacy and\nanonymity for spectrum management with counter DoS and PQ security\nsimultaneously. Our solution introduces the private spectrum bastion (database)\nconcept to exploit existing architectural features of spectrum management\nsystems and then synergizes them with multi-server private information\nretrieval and PQ-secure Tor to guarantee a location-private and anonymous\nacquisition of spectrum information together with hash-based client-server\npuzzles for counter DoS.

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Multimedia Mobile Cloud Computing Using Protective\n  Perturbation",
    "summary" : "Mobile cloud computing has been adopted in many multimedia applications,\nwhere the resource-constrained mobile device sends multimedia data (e.g.,\nimages) to remote cloud servers to request computation-intensive multimedia\nservices (e.g., image recognition). While significantly improving the\nperformance of the mobile applications, the cloud-based mechanism often causes\nprivacy concerns as the multimedia data and services are offloaded from the\ntrusted user device to untrusted cloud servers. Several recent studies have\nproposed perturbation-based privacy preserving mechanisms, which obfuscate the\noffloaded multimedia data to eliminate privacy exposures without affecting the\nfunctionality of the remote multimedia services. However, the existing privacy\nprotection approaches require the deployment of computation-intensive\nperturbation generation on the resource-constrained mobile devices. Also, the\nobfuscated images are typically not compliant with the standard image\ncompression algorithms and suffer from significant bandwidth consumption. In\nthis paper, we develop a novel privacy-preserving multimedia mobile cloud\ncomputing framework, namely $PMC^2$, to address the resource and bandwidth\nchallenges. $PMC^2$ employs secure confidential computing in the cloud to\ndeploy the perturbation generator, which addresses the resource challenge while\nmaintaining the privacy. Furthermore, we develop a neural compressor\nspecifically trained to compress the perturbed images in order to address the\nbandwidth challenge. We implement $PMC^2$ in an end-to-end mobile cloud\ncomputing system, based on which our evaluations demonstrate superior latency,\npower efficiency, and bandwidth consumption achieved by $PMC^2$ while\nmaintaining high accuracy in the target multimedia service.",

    "summary" : "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D computer vision and\ngraphics, facilitating novel view synthesis and influencing sectors like\nextended reality and e-commerce. However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data\ncollection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant\nprivacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this\nconcern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates\nsplit learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model\ntraining between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its\nbenefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack\nmethods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which\nexploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct\nprivate scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce $S^2$NeRF,\nsecure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing\ndecaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient\ninformation, $S^2$NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of\nthe NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of $S^2$NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its\nviability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications.",

Nevertheless, the\npractical availability of SA in currently available FL frameworks is currently\nlimited, due to computational and communication bottlenecks. To fill this gap,\nthis study explores the implementation of SA within the open-source Fed-BioMed\nframework. We implement and compare two SA protocols, Joye-Libert (JL) and Low\nOverhead Masking (LOM), by providing extensive benchmarks in a panel of\nhealthcare data analysis problems. Our theoretical and experimental evaluations\non four datasets demonstrate that SA protocols effectively protect privacy\nwhile maintaining task accuracy. Computational overhead during training is less\nthan 1% on a CPU and less than 50% on a GPU for large models, with protection\nphases taking less than 10 seconds. Incorporating SA into Fed-BioMed impacts\ntask accuracy by no more than 2% compared to non-SA scenarios.

However, privacy\npolicies in the VR ecosystem are still in their early stages, and many\ndevelopers fail to write appropriate privacy policies that comply with\nregulations and meet user expectations. In this paper, we propose VPVet to\nautomatically vet privacy policy compliance issues for VR apps. VPVet first\nanalyzes the availability and completeness of a VR privacy policy and then\nrefines its analysis based on three key criteria: granularity, minimization,\nand consistency of CUS statements. Our study establishes the first and\ncurrently largest VR privacy policy dataset named VRPP, consisting of privacy\npolicies of 11,923 different VR apps from 10 mainstream platforms. Our vetting\nresults reveal severe privacy issues within the VR ecosystem, including the\nlimited availability and poor quality of privacy policies, along with their\ncoarse granularity, lack of adaptation to VR traits and the inconsistency\nbetween CUS statements in privacy policies and their actual behaviors.

    "summary" : "Human pose estimation (HPE) is crucial for various applications. However,\ndeploying HPE algorithms in surveillance contexts raises significant privacy\nconcerns due to the potential leakage of sensitive personal information (SPI)\nsuch as facial features, and ethnicity. Existing privacy-enhancing methods\noften compromise either privacy or performance, or they require costly\nadditional modalities. We propose a novel privacy-enhancing system that\ngenerates privacy-enhanced portraits while maintaining high HPE performance.\nOur key innovations include the reversible recovery of SPI for authorized\npersonnel and the preservation of contextual information. By jointly optimizing\na privacy-enhancing module, a privacy recovery module, and a pose estimator,\nour system ensures robust privacy protection, efficient SPI recovery, and\nhigh-performance HPE. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robust\nperformance in privacy enhancement, SPI recovery, and HPE.",

    "summary" : "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data,\npreserving confidentiality without the need for decryption. However, FHE is\noften hindered by significant performance overhead, particularly for\nhigh-precision and complex data like images. Due to serious efficiency issues,\ntraditional FHE methods often encrypt images by monolithic data blocks (such as\npixel rows), instead of pixels. However, this strategy compromises the\nadvantages of homomorphic operations and disables pixel-level image processing.\nIn this study, we address these challenges by proposing and implementing a\npixel-level homomorphic encryption approach, iCHEETAH, based on the CKKS\nscheme. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching\nmechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values,\nsubstantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in\nencryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image\nquality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering,\nbrightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on\nFHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our\nmethod is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure,\nproviding strong encryption security.

    "summary" : "Differential privacy (DP) provides a provable framework for protecting\nindividuals by customizing a random mechanism over a privacy-sensitive dataset.\nDeep learning models have demonstrated privacy risks in model exposure as an\nestablished learning model unintentionally records membership-level privacy\nleakage. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP- SGD) has been\nproposed to safeguard training individuals by adding random Gaussian noise to\ngradient updates in the backpropagation. Researchers identify that DP-SGD\ntypically causes utility loss since the injected homogeneous noise alters the\ngradient updates calculated at each iteration. Namely, all elements in the\ngradient are contaminated regardless of their importance in updating model\nparameters. In this work, we argue that the utility loss mainly results from\nthe homogeneity of injected noise. Consequently, we propose a generic\ndifferential privacy framework with heterogeneous noise (DP-Hero) by defining a\nheterogeneous random mechanism to abstract its property. The insight of DP-Hero\nis to leverage the knowledge encoded in the previously trained model to guide\nthe subsequent allocation of noise heterogeneity, thereby leveraging the\nstatistical perturbation and achieving enhanced utility. Atop DP-Hero, we\ninstantiate a heterogeneous version of DP-SGD, where the noise injected into\ngradients is heterogeneous and guided by prior-established model parameters. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to verify and explain the effectiveness of\nthe proposed DP-Hero, showing improved training accuracy compared with\nstate-of-the-art works. Broadly, we shed light on improving the privacy-utility\nspace by learning the noise guidance from the pre-existing leaked knowledge\nencoded in the previously trained model, showing a different perspective of\nunderstanding the utility-improved DP training.",

    "summary" : "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to improve recommendation accuracy in\nsparse domains by transferring knowledge from data-rich domains.

Furthermore, these\nmethods suffer from performance degradation in scenarios with sparse\noverlapping users, as they typically depend on a large number of fully shared\nusers for effective knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose\na Federated Prototype-based Contrastive Learning (CL) method for\nPrivacy-Preserving CDR, named FedPCL-CDR. This approach utilizes\nnon-overlapping user information and prototypes to improve multi-domain\nperformance while protecting user privacy. FedPCL-CDR comprises two modules:\nlocal domain (client) learning and global server aggregation. In the local\ndomain, FedPCL-CDR clusters all user data to learn representative prototypes,\neffectively utilizing non-overlapping user information and addressing the\nsparse overlapping user issue. It then facilitates knowledge transfer by\nemploying both local and global prototypes returned from the server in a CL\nmanner. Simultaneously, the global server aggregates representative prototypes\nfrom local domains to learn both local and global prototypes. The combination\nof prototypes and federated learning (FL) ensures that sensitive user data\nremains decentralized, with only prototypes being shared across domains,\nthereby protecting user privacy.

In practice, one needs to address how this shuffle is\nimplemented. Examples include implementing the shuffle via mix-networks, or\nshuffling via a trusted third-party. These implementation specific issues raise\nnon-trivial computational and trust requirements in a classical system. We\npropose a quantum version of the protocol using entanglement of quantum states\nand show that the shuffle can be implemented without these extra requirements.\nOur protocol implements k-ary randomized response, for any value of k > 2, and\nfurthermore, can be efficiently implemented using fault-tolerant computation.",

    "title" : "Protecting Activity Sensing Data Privacy Using Hierarchical Information\n  Dissociation",
    "summary" : "Smartphones and wearable devices have been integrated into our daily lives,\noffering personalized services. However, many apps become overprivileged as\ntheir collected sensing data contains unnecessary sensitive information. For\nexample, mobile sensing data could reveal private attributes (e.g., gender and\nage) and unintended sensitive features (e.g., hand gestures when entering\npasswords). To prevent sensitive information leakage, existing methods must\nobtain private labels and users need to specify privacy policies. However, they\nonly achieve limited control over information disclosure. In this work, we\npresent Hippo to dissociate hierarchical information including private metadata\nand multi-grained activity information from the sensing data. Hippo achieves\nfine-grained control over the disclosure of sensitive information without\nrequiring private labels. Specifically, we design a latent guidance-based\ndiffusion model, which generates multi-grained versions of raw sensor data\nconditioned on hierarchical latent activity features. Hippo enables users to\ncontrol the disclosure of sensitive information in sensing data, ensuring their\nprivacy while preserving the necessary features to meet the utility\nrequirements of applications. Hippo is the first unified model that achieves\ntwo goals: perturbing the sensitive attributes and controlling the disclosure\nof sensitive information in mobile sensing data. Extensive experiments show\nthat Hippo can anonymize personal attributes and transform activity information\nat various resolutions across different types of sensing data.",
