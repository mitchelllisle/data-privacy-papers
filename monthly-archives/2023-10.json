[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00066v1","title":"Assessing Mobile Application Privacy: A Quantitative Framework for Privacy Measurement","summary":"The proliferation of mobile applications and the subsequent sharing of personal data with service and application providers have given rise to substantial privacy concerns. Application marketplaces have introduced mechanisms to conform to regulations and provide individuals with control over their data. However, a notable absence persists regarding clear indications, labels or scores elucidating the privacy implications of these applications. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces a privacy quantification framework. The purpose of this framework is to systematically evaluate the level of privacy risk when using particular Android applications. The main goal is to provide individuals with qualitative labels to make informed decisions about their privacy. This work aims to contribute to a digital environment that prioritizes privacy, promotes informed decision-making, and endorses the privacy-preserving design principles incorporation.","updated":"2023-11-02T00:01:03Z","published":"2023-10-31T18:12:19Z","authors":[{"name":"Joao Marono"},{"name":"Catarina Silva"},{"name":"Joao P.
