    "title" : "Fast, Private, and Protected: Safeguarding Data Privacy and Defending\n  Against Model Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning",
    "summary" : "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein\nparticipants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of\nthe involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,\nproposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect\nagainst potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this\ncontext, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that\naims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to\npreserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using\nparticipants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP\nalso employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of\nattackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of\nFPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,\nand aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that\nFPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of\nmalicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.",

    "title" : "Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO",
    "summary" : "Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning\n(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without\ncentralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing\nsensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a\nclient's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can\nlaunch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client\nparticipated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a\nclient's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),\nthereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing\ninputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client\nexposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates\nmost relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat\nvectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)\nadversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted\ncentral server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes\nthat the server has access to a validation/test set with global data\ndistribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds\nshowed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with\n147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in\ngeneral the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be\nefficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10\ndataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy\nimprovement and 33% cumulative privacy.",

By performing a change of variables\nfor the parameters, the two-parameter R\\'enyi conditional entropy we study\ncoincides precisely with the definition introduced by Hayashi and Tan [IEEE\nTrans.

    "summary" : "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have marked significant impact in traffic state\nprediction, social recommendation, knowledge-aware question answering and so\non. As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a\ncritical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in\ncloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs\nneed to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the\nfinancial cost of cloud computing is another primary concern for users.\nTherefore, although existing studies have proposed privacy-preserving\ntechniques for GNNs in cloud environments, their additional computational and\ncommunication overhead remain relatively high, causing high financial costs\nthat limit their widespread adoption among users.\n  To protect GNN privacy while lowering the additional financial costs, we\nintroduce Panther, a cost-effective privacy-preserving framework for GNN\ntraining and inference services in cloud environments. Technically, Panther\nleverages four-party computation to asynchronously executing the secure array\naccess protocol, and randomly pads the neighbor information of GNN nodes. We\nprove that Panther can protect privacy for both training and inference of GNN\nmodels. Our evaluation shows that Panther reduces the training and inference\ntime by an average of 75.28% and 82.80%, respectively, and communication\noverhead by an average of 52.61% and 50.26% compared with the state-of-the-art,\nwhich is estimated to save an average of 55.05% and 59.00% in financial costs\n(based on on-demand pricing model) for the GNN training and inference process\non Google Cloud Platform.",

    "summary" : "Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's\ninterconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing,\nand database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI)\ndetectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across\nmultiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized\nlearning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data\nownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing.\nCompounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that\nare both robust and adaptable.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL\nplatform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a\nransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure. This\nparadigm is particularly relevant for cybersecurity companies (including both\nsoftware and hardware vendors) that deploy ransomware detection or firewall\nsystems across millions of endpoints. In such environments, data cannot be\ntransferred outside the customer's device due to strict security, privacy, or\nregulatory constraints. Although FL applies broadly to malware threats, we\nvalidate the approach using the Ransomware Storage Access Patterns (RanSAP)\ndataset.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that FL improves ransomware detection accuracy by\na relative 9% over server-local models and achieves performance comparable to\ncentralized training. These results indicate that FL offers a scalable,\nhigh-performing, and privacy-preserving framework for proactive ransomware\ndetection across organizational and regulatory boundaries.",

    "summary" : "Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality synthesis of\nspecific subjects, such as identities or objects. This capability, while\nunlocking new possibilities in content creation, also introduces significant\nprivacy risks, as personalization techniques can be misused by malicious users\nto generate unauthorized content. Although several studies have attempted to\ncounter this by generating adversarially perturbed samples designed to disrupt\npersonalization, they rely on unrealistic assumptions and become ineffective in\nthe presence of even a few clean images or under simple image transformations.\nTo address these challenges, we shift the protection target from the images to\nthe diffusion model itself to hinder the personalization of specific subjects,\nthrough our novel framework called Anti-Personalized Diffusion Models (APDM).\nWe first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a naive approach of\nexisting loss functions to diffusion models is inherently incapable of ensuring\nconvergence for robust anti-personalization. Motivated by this finding, we\nintroduce Direct Protective Optimization (DPO), a novel loss function that\neffectively disrupts subject personalization in the target model without\ncompromising generative quality. Moreover, we propose a new dual-path\noptimization strategy, coined Learning to Protect (L2P). By alternating between\npersonalization and protection paths, L2P simulates future personalization\ntrajectories and adaptively reinforces protection at each step.

However, when\napplied to more realistic scenarios such as batch inference, the HDC-based HE\nhas still very high compute time as well as high encryption and data\ntransmission overheads. To address this problem, we propose HDC with encrypted\nparameters (EP-HDC), which is a novel PPML approach featuring client-side HE,\ni.e., inference is performed on a client using a homomorphically encrypted\nmodel. Our EP-HDC can effectively mitigate the encryption and data transmission\noverhead, as well as providing high scalability with many clients while\nproviding strong protection for user data and model parameters. In addition to\napplication examples for our client-side PPML, we also present design space\nexploration involving quantization, architecture, and HE-related parameters.\nOur experimental results using the BFV scheme and the Face/Emotion datasets\ndemonstrate that our method can improve throughput and latency of batch\ninference by orders of magnitude over previous PPML methods (36.52~1068x and\n6.45~733x, respectively) with less than 1% accuracy degradation.",

    "summary" : "Sharing sensitive time series data in domains such as finance, healthcare,\nand energy consumption, such as patient records or investment accounts, is\noften restricted due to privacy concerns. Privacy-aware synthetic time series\ngeneration addresses this challenge by enforcing noise during training,\ninherently introducing a trade-off between privacy and utility. In many cases,\nsensitive sequences is correlated with publicly available, non-sensitive\ncontextual metadata (e.g., household electricity consumption may be influenced\nby weather conditions and electricity prices). However, existing privacy-aware\ndata generation methods often overlook this opportunity, resulting in\nsuboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs. In this paper, we present Pub2Priv, a\nnovel framework for generating private time series data by leveraging\nheterogeneous public knowledge. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism to\nencode public data into temporal and feature embeddings, which serve as\nconditional inputs for a diffusion model to generate synthetic private\nsequences. Additionally, we introduce a practical metric to assess privacy by\nevaluating the identifiability of the synthetic data. Experimental results show\nthat Pub2Priv consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in improving\nthe privacy-utility trade-off across finance, energy, and commodity trading\ndomains.",

In the evaluation of these mechanisms, an often-ignored aspect is\nthat of dataset size, or rather, the effect of dataset size on a mechanism's\nefficacy for utility and privacy preservation. In this work, we are the first\nto introduce this factor in the evaluation of DP text privatization, where we\ndesign utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets with dynamic split\nsizes. We run these tests on datasets of varying size with up to one million\ntexts, and we focus on quantifying the effect of increasing dataset size on the\nprivacy-utility trade-off.

    "summary" : "The prevalent engagement with mobile apps underscores the importance of\nunderstanding their data practices. Transparency plays a crucial role in this\ncontext, ensuring users to be informed and give consent before any data access\noccurs. Apple introduced a new feature since iOS 15.2, App Privacy Report, to\ninform users about detailed insights into apps' data access and sharing. This\nfeature continues Apple's trend of privacy-focused innovations (following\nPrivacy Nutrition Labels), and has been marketed as a big step forward in user\nprivacy. However, its real-world impacts on user privacy and control remain\nunexamined. We thus proposed an end-to-end study involving systematic\nassessment of the App Privacy Report's real-world benefits and limitations,\nLLM-enabled and multi-technique synthesized enhancements, and comprehensive\nevaluation from both system and user perspectives. Through a structured focus\ngroup study with twelve everyday iOS users, we explored their experiences,\nunderstanding, and perceptions of the feature, suggesting its limited practical\nimpact resulting from missing important details. We identified two primary user\nconcerns: the clarity of data access purpose and domain description. In\nresponse, we proposed enhancements including a purpose inference framework and\ndomain clarification pipeline. We demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits\nof such enhancements for mobile app users. This work provides practical\ninsights that could help enhance user privacy transparency and discusses areas\nfor future research.",

    "summary" : "To discover new insights from data, there is a growing need to share\ninformation that is often held by different organisations. One key task in data\nintegration is the calculation of similarities between records in different\ndatabases to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same\nreal-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the\nowners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or\nshare their data with other organisations to allow such similarity\ncalculations. Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of\nmatching records that refer to the same entity across sensitive databases held\nby different organisations while ensuring no information about the entities is\nrevealed to the participating parties. In this paper, we study how embedding\nbased encoding techniques can be applied in the PPRL context to ensure the\nprivacy of the entities that are being linked. We first convert individual\nq-grams into the embedded space and then convert the embedding of a set of\nq-grams of a given record into a binary representation. The final binary\nrepresentations can be used to link records into matches and non-matches. We\nempirically evaluate our proposed encoding technique against different\nreal-world datasets. The results suggest that our proposed encoding approach\ncan provide better linkage accuracy and protect the privacy of individuals\nagainst attack compared to state-of-the-art techniques for short record values.",

    "summary" : "Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning\n(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without\ncentralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing\nsensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a\nclient's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can\nlaunch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client\nparticipated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a\nclient's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),\nthereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing\ninputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client\nexposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates\nmost relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat\nvectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)\nadversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted\ncentral server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes\nthat the server has access to a validation/test set with global data\ndistribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds\nshowed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with\n147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in\ngeneral the full-aggregation accuracy or even better.
