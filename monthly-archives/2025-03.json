    "title" : "Privacy and Accuracy-Aware AI/ML Model Deduplication",
    "summary" : "With the growing adoption of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms,\nsuch as Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), training\nor fine-tuning models on private datasets has become increasingly prevalent.\nThis shift has led to the need for models offering varying privacy guarantees\nand utility levels to satisfy diverse user requirements. However, managing\nnumerous versions of large models introduces significant operational\nchallenges, including increased inference latency, higher resource consumption,\nand elevated costs. Model deduplication is a technique widely used by many\nmodel serving and database systems to support high-performance and low-cost\ninference queries and model diagnosis queries. However, none of the existing\nmodel deduplication works has considered privacy, leading to unbounded\naggregation of privacy costs for certain deduplicated models and inefficiencies\nwhen applied to deduplicate DP-trained models. We formalize the problems of\ndeduplicating DP-trained models for the first time and propose a novel privacy-\nand accuracy-aware deduplication mechanism to address the problems. We\ndeveloped a greedy strategy to select and assign base models to target models\nto minimize storage and privacy costs. When deduplicating a target model, we\ndynamically schedule accuracy validations and apply the Sparse Vector Technique\nto reduce the privacy costs associated with private validation data. Compared\nto baselines that do not provide privacy guarantees, our approach improved the\ncompression ratio by up to $35\\times$ for individual models (including large\nlanguage models and vision transformers). We also observed up to $43\\times$\ninference speedup due to the reduction of I/O operations.",

    "summary" : "Feedforward control (FF) is often combined with feedback control (FB) in many\ncontrol systems, improving tracking performance, efficiency, and stability.\nHowever, designing effective data-driven FF controllers in multi-agent systems\nrequires significant data collection, including transferring private or\nproprietary data, which raises privacy concerns and incurs high communication\ncosts. Therefore, we propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning\n(FL) into FF control to address these challenges. This approach enables\nprivacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and decentralized continuous\nimprovement of FF controllers across multiple agents without sharing personal\nor proprietary data. By leveraging FL, each agent learns a local, neural FF\ncontroller using its data and contributes only model updates to a global\naggregation process, ensuring data privacy and scalability. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in an autonomous driving use case. Therein,\nvehicles equipped with a trajectory-tracking feedback controller are enhanced\nby FL-based neural FF control. Simulations highlight significant improvements\nin tracking performance compared to pure FB control, analogous to model-based\nFF control. We achieve comparable tracking performance without exchanging\nprivate vehicle-specific data compared to a centralized neural FF control. Our\nresults underscore the potential of FL-based neural FF control to enable\nprivacy-preserving learning in multi-agent control systems, paving the way for\nscalable and efficient autonomous systems applications.",

    "summary" : "The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation\nand has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting\ndifferent diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used\nprimarily in a centralized approach where the data collected from hospitals are\nstored in one center and used to train the nnU-Net. This centralized approach\nhas various limitations, such as leakage of sensitive patient information and\nviolation of patient privacy.

    "summary" : "Considerable effort has been made in privacy-preserving video human activity\nrecognition (HAR). Two primary approaches to ensure privacy preservation in\nVideo HAR are differential privacy (DP) and visual privacy. Techniques\nenforcing DP during training provide strong theoretical privacy guarantees but\noffer limited capabilities for visual privacy assessment. Conversely methods,\nsuch as low-resolution transformations, data obfuscation and adversarial\nnetworks, emphasize visual privacy but lack clear theoretical privacy\nassurances. In this work, we focus on two main objectives: (1) leveraging DP\nproperties to develop a model-free approach for visual privacy in videos and\n(2) evaluating our proposed technique using both differential privacy and\nvisual privacy assessments on HAR tasks. To achieve goal (1), we introduce\nVideo-DPRP: a Video-sample-wise Differentially Private Random Projection\nframework for privacy-preserved video reconstruction for HAR. By using random\nprojections, noise matrices and right singular vectors derived from the\nsingular value decomposition of videos, Video-DPRP reconstructs DP videos using\nprivacy parameters ($\\epsilon,\\delta$) while enabling visual privacy\nassessment. For goal (2), using UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, we compare\nVideo-DPRP's performance on activity recognition with traditional DP methods,\nand state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual privacy-preserving techniques. Additionally,\nwe assess its effectiveness in preserving privacy-related attributes such as\nfacial features, gender, and skin color, using the PA-HMDB and VISPR datasets.\nVideo-DPRP combines privacy-preservation from both a DP and visual privacy\nperspective unlike SOTA methods that typically address only one of these\naspects.",

    "summary" : "A \"privacy behavior\" in software is an action where the software uses\npersonal information for a service or a feature, such as a website using\nlocation to provide content relevant to a user. Programmers are required by\nregulations or application stores to provide privacy notices and labels\ndescribing these privacy behaviors. Although many tools and research prototypes\nhave been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the\nsource code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the\nlevel of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this\nis not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are\nembedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine\nwhat statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views\nare, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to\nexamine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors.\nWe find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated\nwith privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on\nthe attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to\nautomatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three\nlarge language models with the data from the study. We observe that the\nagreement between our approach and participants is comparable to or higher than\nan agreement between two participants. Our study and detection approach can\nhelp programmers understand which statements in code affect privacy in mobile\napplications.",

    "summary" : "The ever growing Internet of Things (IoT) connections drive a new type of\norganization, the Intelligent Enterprise. In intelligent enterprises, machine\nlearning based models are adopted to extract insights from data. Due to the\nefficiency and privacy challenges of these traditional models, a new federated\nlearning (FL) paradigm has emerged. In FL, multiple enterprises can jointly\ntrain a model to update a final model. However, firstly, FL trained models\nusually perform worse than centralized models, especially when enterprises\ntraining data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed). Second, due\nto the centrality of FL and the untrustworthiness of local enterprises,\ntraditional FL solutions are vulnerable to poisoning and inference attacks and\nviolate privacy. Thirdly, the continuous transfer of parameters between\nenterprises and servers increases communication costs. To this end, the\nFedAnil+ model is proposed, a novel, lightweight, and secure Federated Deep\nLearning Model that includes three main phases. In the first phase, the goal is\nto solve the data type distribution skew challenge. Addressing privacy concerns\nagainst poisoning and inference attacks is covered in the second phase.\nFinally, to alleviate the communication overhead, a novel compression approach\nis proposed that significantly reduces the size of the updates. The experiment\nresults validate that FedAnil+ is secure against inference and poisoning\nattacks with better accuracy. In addition, it shows improvements over existing\napproaches in terms of model accuracy (13%, 16%, and 26%), communication cost\n(17%, 21%, and 25%), and computation cost (7%, 9%, and 11%).",

Despite the rapid\ndevelopment of ML-based IoV applications and the growing data privacy concerns,\nthere are limited comprehensive studies on the adoption of PPML within this\ndomain. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of the\nfundamentals, recent advancements, and the challenges of integrating PPML into\nIoV applications. To conduct an extensive study, we first review existing\nsurveys of various PPML techniques and their integration into IoV across\ndifferent scopes. We then discuss the fundamentals of IoV and propose a\nfour-layer IoV architecture. Additionally, we categorize IoV applications into\nthree key domains and analyze the privacy challenges in leveraging ML for these\napplication domains. Next, we provide an overview of various PPML techniques,\nhighlighting their applicability and performance to address the privacy\nchallenges. Building on these fundamentals, we thoroughly review recent\nadvancements in integrating various PPML techniques within IoV applications,\ndiscussing their frameworks, key features, and performance evaluation in terms\nof privacy, utility, and efficiency. Finally, we identify current challenges\nand propose future research directions to enhance privacy and reliability in\nIoV applications.",

    "summary" : "Google's recent update to the manifest file for Chrome browser\nextensions-transitioning from manifest version 2 (MV2) to manifest version 3\n(MV3)-has raised concerns among users and ad blocker providers, who worry that\nthe new restrictions, notably the shift from the powerful WebRequest API to the\nmore restrictive DeclarativeNetRequest API, might reduce ad blocker\neffectiveness. Because ad blockers play a vital role for millions of users\nseeking a more private and ad-free browsing experience, this study empirically\ninvestigates how the MV3 update affects their ability to block ads and\ntrackers. Through a browser-based experiment conducted across multiple samples\nof ad-supported websites, we compare the MV3 to MV2 instances of four widely\nused ad blockers. Our results reveal no statistically significant reduction in\nad-blocking or anti-tracking effectiveness for MV3 ad blockers compared to\ntheir MV2 counterparts, and in some cases, MV3 instances even exhibit slight\nimprovements in blocking trackers. These findings are reassuring for users,\nindicating that the MV3 instances of popular ad blockers continue to provide\neffective protection against intrusive ads and privacy-infringing trackers.\nWhile some uncertainties remain, ad blocker providers appear to have\nsuccessfully navigated the MV3 update, finding solutions that maintain the core\nfunctionality of their ad blockers.",

    "summary" : "Differential privacy (DP) is a privacy-preserving paradigm that protects the\ntraining data when training deep learning models. Critically, the performance\nof models is determined by the training hyperparameters, especially those of\nthe learning rate schedule, thus requiring fine-grained hyperparameter tuning\non the data. In practice, it is common to tune the learning rate\nhyperparameters through the grid search that (1) is computationally expensive\nas multiple runs are needed, and (2) increases the risk of data leakage as the\nselection of hyperparameters is data-dependent. In this work, we adapt the\nautomatic learning rate schedule to DP optimization for any models and\noptimizers, so as to significantly mitigate or even eliminate the cost of\nhyperparameter tuning when applied together with automatic per-sample gradient\nclipping. Our hyperparameter-free DP optimization is almost as computationally\nefficient as the standard non-DP optimization, and achieves state-of-the-art DP\nperformance on various language and vision tasks.",

    "summary" : "Decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization are the three key\nelements driving the twin energy transition. The energy system is evolving to a\nmore data driven ecosystem, leading to the need of communication and storage of\nlarge amount of data of different resolution from the prosumers and other\nstakeholders in the energy ecosystem. While the energy system is certainly\nadvancing, this paradigm shift is bringing in new privacy and security issues\nrelated to collection, processing and storage of data - not only from the\ntechnical dimension, but also from the regulatory perspective. Understanding\ndata privacy and security in the evolving energy system, regarding regulatory\ncompliance, is an immature field of research. Contextualized knowledge of how\nrelated issues are regulated is still in its infancy, and the practical and\ntechnical basis for the regulatory framework for data privacy and security is\nnot clear. To fill this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive review of the\ndata-related issues for the energy system by integrating both technical and\nregulatory dimensions. We start by reviewing open-access data, data\ncommunication and data-processing techniques for the energy system, and use it\nas the basis to connect the analysis of data-related issues from the integrated\nperspective. We classify the issues into three categories: (i) data-sharing\namong energy end users and stakeholders (ii) privacy of end users, and (iii)\ncyber security, and then explore these issues from a regulatory perspective. We\nanalyze the evolution of related regulations, and introduce the relevant\nregulatory initiatives for the categorized issues in terms of regulatory\ndefinitions, concepts, principles, rights and obligations in the context of\nenergy systems. Finally, we provide reflections on the gaps that still exist,\nand guidelines for regulatory frameworks for a truly participatory energy\nsystem.",

    "summary" : "Dementia, a neurological disorder impacting millions globally, presents\nsignificant challenges in diagnosis and patient care. With the rise of privacy\nconcerns and security threats in healthcare, federated learning (FL) has\nemerged as a promising approach to enable collaborative model training across\ndecentralized datasets without exposing sensitive patient information. However,\nFL remains vulnerable to advanced security breaches such as gradient inversion\nand eavesdropping attacks. This paper introduces a novel framework that\nintegrates federated learning with quantum-inspired encryption techniques for\ndementia classification, emphasizing privacy preservation and security.\nLeveraging quantum key distribution (QKD), the framework ensures secure\ntransmission of model weights, protecting against unauthorized access and\ninterception during training. The methodology utilizes a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for dementia classification, with federated training conducted\nacross distributed healthcare nodes, incorporating QKD-encrypted weight sharing\nto secure the aggregation process. Experimental evaluations conducted on MRI\ndata from the OASIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nidentical accuracy levels to a baseline model while enhancing data security and\nreducing loss by almost 1% compared to the classical baseline model. The\nframework offers significant implications for democratizing access to AI-driven\ndementia diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries, addressing critical\nresource and privacy constraints. This work contributes a robust, scalable, and\nsecure federated learning solution for healthcare applications, paving the way\nfor broader adoption of quantum-inspired techniques in AI-driven medical\nresearch.",

    "summary" : "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) raises privacy concerns due to the\nrisk of exposing sensitive training data. Federated learning (FL) mitigates\nthis risk by keeping training samples on local devices, but recent studies show\nthat adversaries can still infer private information from model updates in FL.\nAdditionally, LLM parameters are typically shared publicly during federated\nfine-tuning, while developers are often reluctant to disclose these parameters,\nposing further security challenges. Inspired by the above problems, we propose\nPriFFT, a privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning mechanism, to protect both\nthe model updates and parameters. In PriFFT, clients and the server share model\ninputs and parameters by secret sharing, performing secure fine-tuning on\nshared values without accessing plaintext data. Due to considerable LLM\nparameters, privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning invokes complex secure\ncalculations and requires substantial communication and computation resources.\nTo optimize the efficiency of privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning of LLMs,\nwe introduce function secret-sharing protocols for various operations,\nincluding reciprocal calculation, tensor products, natural exponentiation,\nsoftmax, hyperbolic tangent, and dropout. The proposed protocols achieve up to\n4.02X speed improvement and reduce 7.19X communication overhead compared to the\nimplementation based on existing secret sharing methods.
