    "title" : "Trustworthy Federated Learning: Privacy, Security, and Beyond",
    "summary" : "While recent years have witnessed the advancement in big data and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), it is of much importance to safeguard data privacy and\nsecurity. As an innovative approach, Federated Learning (FL) addresses these\nconcerns by facilitating collaborative model training across distributed data\nsources without transferring raw data. However, the challenges of robust\nsecurity and privacy across decentralized networks catch significant attention\nin dealing with the distributed data in FL. In this paper, we conduct an\nextensive survey of the security and privacy issues prevalent in FL,\nunderscoring the vulnerability of communication links and the potential for\ncyber threats. We delve into various defensive strategies to mitigate these\nrisks, explore the applications of FL across different sectors, and propose\nresearch directions. We identify the intricate security challenges that arise\nwithin the FL frameworks, aiming to contribute to the development of secure and\nefficient FL systems.",

    "title" : "A Practical and Privacy-Preserving Framework for Real-World Large\n  Language Model Services",
    "summary" : "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in\ntext understanding and generation, and they are increasingly being utilized\nacross various domains to enhance productivity. However, due to the high costs\nof training and maintaining these models, coupled with the fact that some LLMs\nare proprietary, individuals often rely on online AI as a Service (AIaaS)\nprovided by LLM companies. This business model poses significant privacy risks,\nas service providers may exploit users' trace patterns and behavioral data. In\nthis paper, we propose a practical and privacy-preserving framework that\nensures user anonymity by preventing service providers from linking requests to\nthe individuals who submit them. Our framework is built on partially blind\nsignatures, which guarantee the unlinkability of user requests. Furthermore, we\nintroduce two strategies tailored to both subscription-based and API-based\nservice models, ensuring the protection of both users' privacy and service\nproviders' interests. The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with\nexisting LLM systems, as it does not require modifications to the underlying\narchitectures. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework incurs\nminimal computation and communication overhead, making it a feasible solution\nfor real-world applications.",

    "summary" : "Data is the main fuel of a successful machine learning model. A dataset may\ncontain sensitive individual records e.g. personal health records, financial\ndata, industrial information, etc. Training a model using this sensitive data\nhas become a new privacy concern when someone uses third-party cloud computing.\nTrained models also suffer privacy attacks which leads to the leaking of\nsensitive information of the training data. This study is conducted to preserve\nthe privacy of training data in the context of customer churn prediction\nmodeling for the telecommunications industry (TCI). In this work, we propose a\nframework for privacy-preserving customer churn prediction (PPCCP) model in the\ncloud environment. We have proposed a novel approach which is a combination of\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE).\nSynthetic data is generated from GANs, and aWOE is applied on the synthetic\ntraining dataset before feeding the data to the classification algorithms. Our\nexperiments were carried out using eight different machine learning (ML)\nclassifiers on three openly accessible datasets from the telecommunication\nsector. We then evaluated the performance using six commonly employed\nevaluation metrics. In addition to presenting a data privacy analysis, we also\nperformed a statistical significance test. The training and prediction\nprocesses achieve data privacy and the prediction classifiers achieve high\nprediction performance (87.1\\% in terms of F-Measure for GANs-aWOE based\nNa\\\"{\\i}ve Bayes model). In contrast to earlier studies, our suggested approach\ndemonstrates a prediction enhancement of up to 28.9\\% and 27.9\\% in terms of\naccuracy and F-measure, respectively.",

    "summary" : "In this paper, we introduce WaKA (Wasserstein K-nearest neighbors\nAttribution), a novel attribution method that leverages principles from the\nLiRA (Likelihood Ratio Attack) framework and applies them to \\( k \\)-nearest\nneighbors classifiers (\\( k \\)-NN). WaKA efficiently measures the contribution\nof individual data points to the model's loss distribution, analyzing every\npossible \\( k \\)-NN that can be constructed using the training set, without\nrequiring sampling or shadow model training. WaKA can be used \\emph{a\nposteriori} as a membership inference attack (MIA) to assess privacy risks, and\n\\emph{a priori} for data minimization and privacy influence measurement. Thus,\nWaKA can be seen as bridging the gap between data attribution and membership\ninference attack (MIA) literature by distinguishing between the value of a data\npoint and its privacy risk. For instance, we show that self-attribution values\nare more strongly correlated with the attack success rate than the contribution\nof a point to model generalization. WaKA's different usages were also evaluated\nacross diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating performance very close to\nLiRA when used as an MIA on \\( k \\)-NN classifiers, but with greater\ncomputational efficiency.",

Our system performs three distinct\nfunctions thaat real time ECG monitoring and disease detection, encrypted\nstorage and synchronized visualization, and statistical analysis on encrypted\ndata. At its core, the system uses a three lead ECG preamplifier connected\nthrough a serial port to capture, display, and record real time ECG data. These\nsignals are securely stored in the cloud using robust encryption methods.\nAuthorized medical personnel can access and decrypt this data on their\ncomputers, with AES encryption ensuring synchronized real time data tracking\nand visualization. Furthermore, the system performs statistical operations on\nthe ECG data stored in the cloud without decrypting it, using Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE). This enables privacy preserving data analysis while ensuring\nthe security and confidentiality of patient information. By integrating these\nindependent functions, our system significantly enhances the security and\nefficiency of health monitoring. It supports critical tasks such as disease\ndetection, patient monitoring, and preliminary intervention, all while\nupholding stringent data privacy standards.

The results highlight the potential of this system to\nimprove patient care through secure and efficient ECG monitoring and analysis.\nThis work represents a significant leap forward in medical technology.

    "summary" : "Federated Learning (FL) is essential for efficient data exchange in Internet\nof Things (IoT) environments, as it trains Machine Learning (ML) models locally\nand shares only model updates. However, FL is vulnerable to privacy threats\nlike model inversion and membership inference attacks, which can expose\nsensitive training data. To address these privacy concerns, Differential\nPrivacy (DP) mechanisms are often applied. Yet, adding DP noise to black-box ML\nmodels degrades performance, especially in dynamic IoT systems where\ncontinuous, lifelong FL learning accumulates excessive noise over time. To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce Federated HyperDimensional computing with\nPrivacy-preserving (FedHDPrivacy), an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\nframework that combines the neuro-symbolic paradigm with DP. FedHDPrivacy\ncarefully manages the balance between privacy and performance by theoretically\ntracking cumulative noise from previous rounds and adding only the necessary\nincremental noise to meet privacy requirements. In a real-world case study\ninvolving in-process monitoring of manufacturing machining operations,\nFedHDPrivacy demonstrates robust performance, outperforming standard FL\nframeworks-including Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Stochastic\nGradient Descent (FedSGD), Federated Proximal (FedProx), Federated Normalized\nAveraging (FedNova), and Federated Adam (FedAdam)-by up to 38%.

However, performance of FL rapidly\ndegrades in practical scenarios due to the inherent bias in non Independent and\nIdentically distributed (non-IID) data among participating clients, which poses\nsignificant challenges to model accuracy and generalization.

    "summary" : "With the extensive use of machine learning technologies, data providers\nencounter increasing privacy risks. Recent legislation, such as GDPR, obligates\norganizations to remove requested data and its influence from a trained model.\nMachine unlearning is an emerging technique designed to enable machine learning\nmodels to erase users' private information. Although several efficient machine\nunlearning schemes have been proposed, these methods still have limitations.\nFirst, removing the contributions of partial data may lead to model performance\ndegradation. Second, discrepancies between the original and generated unlearned\nmodels can be exploited by attackers to obtain target sample's information,\nresulting in additional privacy leakage risks. To address above challenges, we\nproposed a game-theoretic machine unlearning algorithm that simulates the\ncompetitive relationship between unlearning performance and privacy protection.\nThis algorithm comprises unlearning and privacy modules. The unlearning module\npossesses a loss function composed of model distance and classification error,\nwhich is used to derive the optimal strategy. The privacy module aims to make\nit difficult for an attacker to infer membership information from the unlearned\ndata, thereby reducing the privacy leakage risk during the unlearning process.\nAdditionally, the experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that\nthis game-theoretic unlearning algorithm's effectiveness and its ability to\ngenerate an unlearned model with a performance similar to that of the retrained\none while mitigating extra privacy leakage risks.",

    "summary" : "With the widespread adoption of edge computing technologies and the\nincreasing prevalence of deep learning models in these environments, the\nsecurity risks and privacy threats to models and data have grown more acute.\nAttackers can exploit various techniques to illegally obtain models or misuse\ndata, leading to serious issues such as intellectual property infringement and\nprivacy breaches. Existing model access control technologies primarily rely on\ntraditional encryption and authentication methods; however, these approaches\nexhibit significant limitations in terms of flexibility and adaptability in\ndynamic environments. Although there have been advancements in model\nwatermarking techniques for marking model ownership, they remain limited in\ntheir ability to proactively protect intellectual property and prevent\nunauthorized access. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model\naccess control method tailored for edge computing environments. This method\nleverages image style as a licensing mechanism, embedding style recognition\ninto the model's operational framework to enable intrinsic access control.\nConsequently, models deployed on edge platforms are designed to correctly infer\nonly on license data with specific style, rendering them ineffective on any\nother data. By restricting the input data to the edge model, this approach not\nonly prevents attackers from gaining unauthorized access to the model but also\nenhances the privacy of data on terminal devices. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FACESCRUB,\nand the results demonstrate that our method effectively prevents unauthorized\naccess to the model while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the model shows\nstrong resistance against attacks such as forged licenses and fine-tuning.\nThese results underscore the method's usability, security, and robustness.",

    "summary" : "Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations are expected to transform air\ntransportation while challenging current air traffic management practices. By\nintroducing a novel market-based mechanism, we address the problem of on-demand\nallocation of capacity-constrained airspace to AAM vehicles with heterogeneous\nand private valuations. We model airspace and air infrastructure as a\ncollection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles\nthat simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region. Vehicles request access\nto the airspace with trajectories spanning multiple regions at different times.\nWe use the graph structure of our airspace model to formulate the allocation\nproblem as a path allocation problem on a time-extended graph. To ensure the\ncost information of AAM vehicles remains private, we introduce a novel\nmechanism that allocates each vehicle a budget of \"air-credits\" and anonymously\ncharges prices for traversing the edges of the time-extended graph. We seek to\ncompute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints\nare satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector\ncapacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal\nfor each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to\nindividual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral\nallocations may not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the\nexistence and computation of a fractional-competitive equilibrium, where\nallocations can be fractional. Building on these theoretical insights, we\npropose a distributed, iterative, two-step algorithm that: 1) computes a\nfractional competitive equilibrium, and 2) derives an integral allocation from\nthis equilibrium. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in allocating\ntrajectories for two emerging urban air mobility services: drone delivery and\nair taxis.",

We\nevaluate and compare those methods within each category, highlighting their\nstrengths and weaknesses in terms of utility, privacy, and computational\ncomplexity.

With the\nrapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the development of numerous\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models has\nbeen applied to the precise segmentation of WSIs. However, due to privacy\nregulations and the need to protect patient confidentiality, centralized\nstorage and processing of image data are impractical.

Additionally, to address the issue of original data reconstruction\nthrough gradient inversion during the federated learning training process,\ndifferential privacy introduces noise into the model updates, preventing\nattackers from inferring the contributions of individual samples, thereby\nprotecting the privacy of the training data.Experimental results show that the\nproposed method, FedDP, minimally impacts model accuracy while effectively\nsafeguarding the privacy of cancer pathology image data, with only a slight\ndecrease in Dice, Jaccard, and Acc indices by 0.55%, 0.63%, and 0.42%,\nrespectively.

While one might be able to afford this for small models, the cost\noften becomes prohibitive for medium and large models.\n  We here instead propose a novel approach to identify the at-risk samples\nusing only artifacts available during training, with little to no additional\ncomputational overhead. Our method analyzes individual per-sample loss traces\nand uses them to identify the vulnerable data samples. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our artifact-based approach through experiments on the CIFAR10\ndataset, showing high precision in identifying vulnerable samples as determined\nby a SOTA shadow model-based MIA (LiRA). Impressively, our method reaches the\nsame precision as another SOTA MIA when measured against LiRA, despite it being\norders of magnitude cheaper. We then show LT-IQR to outperform alternative loss\naggregation methods, perform ablation studies on hyperparameters, and validate\nthe robustness of our method to the target metric.

This class imbalance presents a\nsignificant algorithmic challenge, which can be further exacerbated when\nprivacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy are applied to\nprotect sensitive training data. Our work formalizes these challenges and\nprovides a number of algorithmic solutions. We consider DP variants of\npre-processing methods that privately augment the original dataset to reduce\nthe class imbalance; these include oversampling, SMOTE, and private synthetic\ndata generation. We also consider DP variants of in-processing techniques,\nwhich adjust the learning algorithm to account for the imbalance; these include\nmodel bagging, class-weighted empirical risk minimization and class-weighted\ndeep learning. For each method, we either adapt an existing imbalanced learning\ntechnique to the private setting or demonstrate its incompatibility with\ndifferential privacy. Finally, we empirically evaluate these privacy-preserving\nimbalanced learning methods under various data and distributional settings. We\nfind that private synthetic data methods perform well as a data pre-processing\nstep, while class-weighted ERMs are an alternative in higher-dimensional\nsettings where private synthetic data suffers from the curse of dimensionality.",

    "title" : "The Limits of Differential Privacy in Online Learning",
    "summary" : "Differential privacy (DP) is a formal notion that restricts the privacy\nleakage of an algorithm when running on sensitive data, in which\nprivacy-utility trade-off is one of the central problems in private data\nanalysis. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of differential\nprivacy in online learning algorithms and present evidence that separates three\ntypes of constraints: no DP, pure DP, and approximate DP. We first describe a\nhypothesis class that is online learnable under approximate DP but not online\nlearnable under pure DP under the adaptive adversarial setting. This indicates\nthat approximate DP must be adopted when dealing with adaptive adversaries. We\nthen prove that any private online learner must make an infinite number of\nmistakes for almost all hypothesis classes. This essentially generalizes\nprevious results and shows a strong separation between private and non-private\nsettings since a finite mistake bound is always attainable (as long as the\nclass is online learnable) when there is no privacy requirement.",

    "summary" : "Advancements in genomics technology lead to a rising volume of viral (e.g.,\nSARS-CoV-2) sequence data, resulting in increased usage of machine learning\n(ML) in bioinformatics. Traditional ML techniques require centralized data\ncollection and processing, posing challenges in realistic healthcare scenarios.\nAdditionally, privacy, ownership, and stringent regulation issues exist when\npooling medical data into centralized storage to train a powerful deep learning\n(DL) model. The Federated learning (FL) approach overcomes such issues by\nsetting up a central aggregator server and a shared global model. It also\nfacilitates data privacy by extracting knowledge while keeping the actual data\nprivate. This work proposes a cutting-edge Privacy enhancement through\nIterative Collaboration (EPIC) architecture. The network is divided and\ndistributed between local and centralized servers. We demonstrate the EPIC\napproach to resolve a supervised classification problem to estimate SARS-CoV-2\ngenomic sequence data lineage without explicitly transferring raw sequence\ndata. We aim to create a universal decentralized optimization framework that\nallows various data holders to work together and converge to a single\npredictive model.

    "summary" : "Embeddings have become a cornerstone in the functionality of large language\nmodels (LLMs) due to their ability to transform text data into rich, dense\nnumerical representations that capture semantic and syntactic properties. These\nembedding vector databases serve as the long-term memory of LLMs, enabling\nefficient handling of a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\nHowever, the surge in popularity of embedding vector databases in LLMs has been\naccompanied by significant concerns about privacy leakage.

    "summary" : "The advancement of 5G and NextG networks through Open Radio Access Network\n(O-RAN) architecture enables a shift toward virtualized, modular, and\ndisaggregated configurations. A core component of O-RAN is the RAN Intelligent\nController (RIC), which manages RAN using machine learning-driven xApps that\naccess sensitive data from RAN and User Equipment (UE), stored in the near\nReal-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC) database. This shared, open environment increases\nthe risk of unauthorized data exposure. To address these concerns, this paper\nproposes a zero-trust RIC (ZT-RIC) framework that preserves data privacy across\nthe RIC platform, including the RIC database, xApps, and E2 interface. ZT-RIC\nemploys Inner Product Functional Encryption (IPFE) to encrypt RAN/UE data at\nthe base station, preventing leaks through the E2 interface and shared\ndatabase. Additionally, ZT-RIC enables xApps to perform inference on encrypted\ndata without exposing sensitive information. For evaluation, a state-of-the-art\nInterClass xApp, which detects jamming signals using RAN key performance\nmetrics (KPMs), is implemented. Testing on an LTE/5G O-RAN testbed shows that\nZT-RIC preserves data confidentiality while achieving 97.9% accuracy in jamming\ndetection and meeting sub-second latency requirements, with a round-trip time\n(RTT) of 0.527 seconds.",

Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models\ncan reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic\narchitectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as\npromising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven\nprocessing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied;\nhowever, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs.\nThis paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs,\nwe assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets.\nWe analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and\nevolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN\nprivacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy\npreservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience. For\ninstance, on CIFAR-10, SNNs achieve an AUC of 0.59, significantly lower than\nANNs' 0.82, and on CIFAR-100, SNNs maintain an AUC of 0.58 compared to ANNs'\n0.88.

    "summary" : "Shared energy storage systems (ESS) present a promising solution to the\ntemporal imbalance between energy generation from renewable distributed\ngenerators (DGs) and the power demands of prosumers. However, as DG penetration\nrates rise, spatial energy imbalances become increasingly significant,\nnecessitating the integration of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within the\nshared ESS framework. Two key challenges emerge in this context: the absence of\neffective mechanisms and the greater difficulty for privacy protection due to\nincreased data communication. This research proposes a capacity renting\nframework for shared ESS considering P2P energy trading of prosumers. In the\nproposed framework, prosumers can participate in P2P energy trading and rent\ncapacities from shared ESS. A generalized Nash game is formulated to model the\ntrading process and the competitive interactions among prosumers, and the\nvariational equilibrium of the game is proved to be equivalent to the optimal\nsolution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem. To address the privacy\nprotection concern, the problem is solved using the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) with the Paillier cryptosystem.

However, the effectiveness of AML solutions is hindered by data silos\nwithin financial institutions, limiting collaboration and overall efficacy.\nThis research presents a novel privacy-preserving approach for collaborative\nAML machine learning, facilitating secure data sharing across institutions and\nborders while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance. Leveraging Fully\nHomomorphic Encryption (FHE), computations are directly performed on encrypted\ndata, ensuring the confidentiality of financial data. Notably, FHE over the\nTorus (TFHE) was integrated with graph-based machine learning using Zama\nConcrete ML. The research contributes two key privacy-preserving pipelines.\nFirst, the development of a privacy-preserving Graph Neural Network (GNN)\npipeline was explored. Optimization techniques like quantization and pruning\nwere used to render the GNN FHE-compatible. Second, a privacy-preserving\ngraph-based XGBoost pipeline leveraging Graph Feature Preprocessor (GFP) was\nsuccessfully developed. Experiments demonstrated strong predictive performance,\nwith the XGBoost model consistently achieving over 99% accuracy, F1-score,\nprecision, and recall on the balanced AML dataset in both unencrypted and\nFHE-encrypted inference settings. On the imbalanced dataset, the incorporation\nof graph-based features improved the F1-score by 8%. The research highlights\nthe need to balance the trade-off between privacy and computational efficiency.",

    "title" : "Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Differential Privacy over Wireless\n  Networks",
    "summary" : "Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models (FMs) on distributed edge\ndevices presents considerable computational and privacy challenges. Federated\nfine-tuning (FedFT) mitigates some privacy issues by facilitating collaborative\nmodel training without the need to share raw data. To lessen the computational\nburden on resource-limited devices, combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with\nfederated learning enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Additionally, the\nsplit FedFT architecture partitions an FM between edge devices and a central\nserver, reducing the necessity for complete model deployment on individual\ndevices. However, the risk of privacy eavesdropping attacks in FedFT remains a\nconcern, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare and finance. In\nthis paper, we propose a split FedFT framework with differential privacy (DP)\nover wireless networks, where the inherent wireless channel noise in the uplink\ntransmission is utilized to achieve DP guarantees without adding an extra\nartificial noise. We shall investigate the impact of the wireless noise on\nconvergence performance of the proposed framework. We will also show that by\nupdating only one of the low-rank matrices in the split FedFT with DP, the\nproposed method can mitigate the noise amplification effect. Simulation results\nwill demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy under\nstrict privacy budgets compared to baseline methods.",

    "title" : "New Emerged Security and Privacy of Pre-trained Model: a Survey and\n  Outlook",
    "summary" : "Thanks to the explosive growth of data and the development of computational\nresources, it is possible to build pre-trained models that can achieve\noutstanding performance on various tasks, such as neural language processing,\ncomputer vision, and more. Despite their powerful capabilities, pre-trained\nmodels have also sparked attention to the emerging security challenges\nassociated with their real-world applications. Security and privacy issues,\nsuch as leaking privacy information and generating harmful responses, have\nseriously undermined users' confidence in these powerful models. Concerns are\ngrowing as model performance improves dramatically. Researchers are eager to\nexplore the unique security and privacy issues that have emerged, their\ndistinguishing factors, and how to defend against them. However, the current\nliterature lacks a clear taxonomy of emerging attacks and defenses for\npre-trained models, which hinders a high-level and comprehensive understanding\nof these questions. To fill the gap, we conduct a systematical survey on the\nsecurity risks of pre-trained models, proposing a taxonomy of attack and\ndefense methods based on the accessibility of pre-trained models' input and\nweights in various security test scenarios. This taxonomy categorizes attacks\nand defenses into No-Change, Input-Change, and Model-Change approaches. With\nthe taxonomy analysis, we capture the unique security and privacy issues of\npre-trained models, categorizing and summarizing existing security issues based\non their characteristics. In addition, we offer a timely and comprehensive\nreview of each category's strengths and limitations. Our survey concludes by\nhighlighting potential new research opportunities in the security and privacy\nof pre-trained models.",

However, recent studies reveal that fine-tuning data,\ndue to their sensitive nature, domain-specific characteristics, and\nidentifiability, pose significant privacy concerns.

    "title" : "Synthesis with Privacy Against an Observer",
    "summary" : "We study automatic synthesis of systems that interact with their environment\nand maintain privacy against an observer to the interaction. The system and the\nenvironment interact via sets $I$ and $O$ of input and output signals. The\ninput to the synthesis problem contains, in addition to a specification, also a\nlist of secrets, a function $cost: I\\cup O\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}$, which maps\neach signal to the cost of hiding it, and a bound $b\\in\\mathbb{N}$ on the\nbudget that the system may use for hiding of signals. The desired output is an\n$(I/O)$-transducer $T$ and a set $H\\subseteq I\\cup O$ of signals that respects\nthe bound on the budget, thus $\\sum_{s\\in H} cost(s)\\leq b$, such that for\nevery possible interaction of $T$, the generated computation satisfies the\nspecification, yet an observer, from whom the signals in $H$ are hidden, cannot\nevaluate the secrets.\n  We first show that the problem's complexity is 2EXPTIME-complete for\nspecifications and secrets in LTL, making it no harder than synthesis without\nprivacy requirements. We then analyze the complexity further, isolating the two\naspects that do not exist in traditional synthesis: the need to hide secret\nvalues and the need to choose the set $H$. We do this by studying settings in\nwhich traditional synthesis is solvable in polynomial time -- when the\nspecification formalism is deterministic automata and when the system is closed\n-- and show that each of these aspects adds an exponential blow-up in\ncomplexity. We continue and study bounded synthesis with privacy, where the\ninput includes a bound on the synthesized transducer size, as well as a variant\nof the problem in which the observer has knowledge, either about the\nspecification or about the system, which can be helpful in evaluating the\nsecrets. Additionally, we study certified privacy, where the synthesis\nalgorithm provides certification that the secrets remain hidden.",
