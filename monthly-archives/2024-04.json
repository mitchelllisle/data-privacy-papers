    "title" : "Making Privacy-preserving Federated Graph Analytics with Strong\n  Guarantees Practical (for Certain Queries)",
    "summary" : "Privacy-preserving federated graph analytics is an emerging area of research.\nThe goal is to run graph analytics queries over a set of devices that are\norganized as a graph while keeping the raw data on the devices rather than\ncentralizing it. Further, no entity may learn any new information except for\nthe final query result. For instance, a device may not learn a neighbor's data.\nThe state-of-the-art prior work for this problem provides privacy guarantees\nfor a broad set of queries in a strong threat model where the devices can be\nmalicious. However, it imposes an impractical overhead: each device locally\nrequires over 8.79 hours of cpu time and 5.73 GiBs of network transfers per\nquery. This paper presents Colo, a new, low-cost system for privacy-preserving\nfederated graph analytics that requires minutes of cpu time and a few MiBs in\nnetwork transfers, for a particular subset of queries. At the heart of Colo is\na new secure computation protocol that enables a device to securely and\nefficiently evaluate a graph query in its local neighborhood while hiding\ndevice data, edge data, and topology data. An implementation and evaluation of\nColo shows that for running a variety of COVID-19 queries over a population of\n1M devices, it requires less than 8.4 minutes of a device's CPU time and 4.93\nMiBs in network transfers - improvements of up to three orders of magnitude.",

    "summary" : "With the increase in the number of privacy regulations, small development\nteams are forced to make privacy decisions on their own. In this paper, we\nconduct a mixed-method survey study, including statistical and qualitative\nanalysis, to evaluate the privacy perceptions, practices, and knowledge of\nmembers involved in various phases of software development (SDLC). Our survey\nincludes 362 participants from 23 countries, encompassing roles such as product\nmanagers, developers, and testers. Our results show diverse definitions of\nprivacy across SDLC roles, emphasizing the need for a holistic privacy approach\nthroughout SDLC. We find that software teams, regardless of their region, are\nless familiar with privacy concepts (such as anonymization), relying on\nself-teaching and forums. Most participants are more familiar with GDPR and\nHIPAA than other regulations, with multi-jurisdictional compliance being their\nprimary concern. Our results advocate the need for role-dependent solutions to\naddress the privacy challenges, and we highlight research directions and\neducational takeaways to help improve privacy-aware software development.",

First, we expand\nthe existing framework for collaborative dictionary learning (CollabDict),\nwhich has previously been limited to Gaussian mixture models, by incorporating\ndeep variational autoencoders (VAEs) into the framework, with a particular\nfocus on anomaly detection. We demonstrate that the VAE-based anomaly score\nfunction shares the same mathematical structure as the non-deep model, and\nprovide comprehensive qualitative comparison. Second, considering the\nwidespread use of \"pre-trained models,\" we provide a mathematical analysis on\ndata privacy leakage when models trained with CollabDict are shared externally.\nWe show that the CollabDict approach, when applied to Gaussian mixtures,\nadheres to a Renyi differential privacy criterion.

    "summary" : "It is commonplace to produce application-specific models by fine-tuning large\npre-trained models using a small bespoke dataset. The widespread availability\nof foundation model checkpoints on the web poses considerable risks, including\nthe vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we unveil a new\nvulnerability: the privacy backdoor attack. This black-box privacy attack aims\nto amplify the privacy leakage that arises when fine-tuning a model: when a\nvictim fine-tunes a backdoored model, their training data will be leaked at a\nsignificantly higher rate than if they had fine-tuned a typical model. We\nconduct extensive experiments on various datasets and models, including both\nvision-language models (CLIP) and large language models, demonstrating the\nbroad applicability and effectiveness of such an attack. Additionally, we carry\nout multiple ablation studies with different fine-tuning methods and inference\nstrategies to thoroughly analyze this new threat.

    "summary" : "Unsupervised (US) video anomaly detection (VAD) in surveillance applications\nis gaining more popularity recently due to its practical real-world\napplications. As surveillance videos are privacy sensitive and the availability\nof large-scale video data may enable better US-VAD systems, collaborative\nlearning can be highly rewarding in this setting. However, due to the extremely\nchallenging nature of the US-VAD task, where learning is carried out without\nany annotations, privacy-preserving collaborative learning of US-VAD systems\nhas not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a new baseline for anomaly\ndetection capable of localizing anomalous events in complex surveillance videos\nin a fully unsupervised fashion without any labels on a privacy-preserving\nparticipant-based distributed training configuration. Additionally, we propose\nthree new evaluation protocols to benchmark anomaly detection approaches on\nvarious scenarios of collaborations and data availability. Based on these\nprotocols, we modify existing VAD datasets to extensively evaluate our approach\nas well as existing US SOTA methods on two large-scale datasets including\nUCF-Crime and XD-Violence.

    "summary" : "In this study, we apply the information-theoretic Privacy Funnel (PF) model\nto the domain of face recognition, developing a novel method for\nprivacy-preserving representation learning within an end-to-end training\nframework. Our approach addresses the trade-off between obfuscation and utility\nin data protection, quantified through logarithmic loss, also known as\nself-information loss. This research provides a foundational exploration into\nthe integration of information-theoretic privacy principles with representation\nlearning, focusing specifically on the face recognition systems. We\nparticularly highlight the adaptability of our framework with recent\nadvancements in face recognition networks, such as AdaFace and ArcFace. In\naddition, we introduce the Generative Privacy Funnel ($\\mathsf{GenPF}$) model,\na paradigm that extends beyond the traditional scope of the PF model, referred\nto as the Discriminative Privacy Funnel ($\\mathsf{DisPF}$). This\n$\\mathsf{GenPF}$ model brings new perspectives on data generation methods with\nestimation-theoretic and information-theoretic privacy guarantees.\nComplementing these developments, we also present the deep variational PF\n(DVPF) model. This model proposes a tractable variational bound for measuring\ninformation leakage, enhancing the understanding of privacy preservation\nchallenges in deep representation learning. The DVPF model, associated with\nboth $\\mathsf{DisPF}$ and $\\mathsf{GenPF}$ models, sheds light on connections\nwith various generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion models. Complementing our\ntheoretical contributions, we release a reproducible PyTorch package,\nfacilitating further exploration and application of these privacy-preserving\nmethodologies in face recognition systems.",

Despite their great success, the knowledge\nprovided by the retrieval process is not always useful for improving the model\nprediction, since in some samples LLMs may already be quite knowledgeable and\nthus be able to answer the question correctly without retrieval. Aiming to save\nthe cost of retrieval, previous work has proposed to determine when to do/skip\nthe retrieval in a data-aware manner by analyzing the LLMs' pretraining data.\nHowever, these data-aware methods pose privacy risks and memory limitations,\nespecially when requiring access to sensitive or extensive pretraining data.\nMoreover, these methods offer limited adaptability under fine-tuning or\ncontinual learning settings. We hypothesize that token embeddings are able to\ncapture the model's intrinsic knowledge, which offers a safer and more\nstraightforward way to judge the need for retrieval without the privacy risks\nassociated with accessing pre-training data. Moreover, it alleviates the need\nto retain all the data utilized during model pre-training, necessitating only\nthe upkeep of the token embeddings.

    "summary" : "Image data have been extensively used in Deep Neural Network (DNN) tasks in\nvarious scenarios, e.g., autonomous driving and medical image analysis, which\nincurs significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy protection techniques are\nunable to efficiently protect such data. For example, Differential Privacy (DP)\nthat is an emerging technique protects data with strong privacy guarantee\ncannot effectively protect visual features of exposed image dataset. In this\npaper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving framework VisualMixer that\nprotects the training data of visual DNN tasks by pixel shuffling, while not\ninjecting any noises. VisualMixer utilizes a new privacy metric called Visual\nFeature Entropy (VFE) to effectively quantify the visual features of an image\nfrom both biological and machine vision aspects. In VisualMixer, we devise a\ntask-agnostic image obfuscation method to protect the visual privacy of data\nfor DNN training and inference. For each image, it determines regions for pixel\nshuffling in the image and the sizes of these regions according to the desired\nVFE. It shuffles pixels both in the spatial domain and in the chromatic channel\nspace in the regions without injecting noises so that it can prevent visual\nfeatures from being discerned and recognized, while incurring negligible\naccuracy loss. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that\nVisualMixer can effectively preserve the visual privacy with negligible\naccuracy loss, i.e., at average 2.35 percentage points of model accuracy loss,\nand almost no performance degradation on model training.",

    "summary" : "The notion of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy is a widely used concept of\nproviding quantifiable privacy to individuals. However, it is unclear how to\nexplain the level of privacy protection provided by a differential privacy\nmechanism with a set $\\varepsilon$. In this study, we focus on users'\ncomprehension of the privacy protection provided by a differential privacy\nmechanism. To do so, we study three variants of explaining the privacy\nprotection provided by differential privacy: (1) the original mathematical\ndefinition; (2) $\\varepsilon$ translated into a specific privacy risk; and (3)\nan explanation using the randomized response technique. We compare users'\ncomprehension of privacy protection employing these explanatory models with\ntheir comprehension of privacy protection of $k$-anonymity as baseline\ncomprehensibility. Our findings suggest that participants' comprehension of\ndifferential privacy protection is enhanced by the privacy risk model and the\nrandomized response-based model. Moreover, our results confirm our intuition\nthat privacy protection provided by $k$-anonymity is more comprehensible.",

    "summary" : "Time series have numerous applications in finance, healthcare, IoT, and smart\ncity. In many of these applications, time series typically contain personal\ndata, so privacy infringement may occur if they are released directly to the\npublic. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as the\nstate-of-the-art approach to protecting data privacy. However, existing works\non LDP-based collections cannot preserve the shape of time series. A recent\nwork, PatternLDP, attempts to address this problem, but it can only protect a\nfinite group of elements in a time series due to {\\omega}-event level privacy\nguarantee. In this paper, we propose PrivShape, a trie-based mechanism under\nuser-level LDP to protect all elements. PrivShape first transforms a time\nseries to reduce its length, and then adopts trie-expansion and two-level\nrefinement to improve utility. By extensive experiments on real-world datasets,\nwe demonstrate that PrivShape outperforms PatternLDP when adapted for offline\nuse, and can effectively extract frequent shapes.",

    "summary" : "gRPC is at the heart of modern distributed system architectures. Based on\nHTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, it provides highly performant, standardized, and\npolyglot communication across loosely coupled microservices and is increasingly\npreferred over REST- or GraphQL-based service APIs in practice. Despite its\nwidespread adoption, gRPC lacks any advanced privacy techniques beyond\ntransport encryption and basic token-based authentication. Such advanced\ntechniques are, however, increasingly important for fulfilling regulatory\nrequirements. For instance, anonymizing or otherwise minimizing (personal) data\nbefore responding to requests, or pre-processing data based on the purpose of\nthe access may be crucial in certain usecases. In this paper, we therefore\npropose a novel approach for integrating such advanced privacy techniques into\nthe gRPC framework in a practically viable way. Specifically, we present a\ngeneral approach along with a working prototype that implements privacy\ntechniques, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, in a\nconfigurable, extensible, and gRPC-native way utilizing a gRPC interceptor. We\nalso showcase how to integrate this contribution into a realistic example of a\nfood delivery use case.

To evaluate the SR performance, a metric\ntermed angular-domain peak-to-average ratio (ADPAR) is first defined and\nanalyzed.

    "summary" : "Despite achieving good performance and wide adoption, machine learning based\nsecurity detection models (e.g., malware classifiers) are subject to concept\ndrift and evasive evolution of attackers, which renders up-to-date threat data\nas a necessity. However, due to enforcement of various privacy protection\nregulations (e.g., GDPR), it is becoming increasingly challenging or even\nprohibitive for security vendors to collect individual-relevant and\nprivacy-sensitive threat datasets, e.g., SMS spam/non-spam messages from mobile\ndevices. To address such obstacles, this study systematically profiles the\n(in)feasibility of federated learning for privacy-preserving cyber threat\ndetection in terms of effectiveness, byzantine resilience, and efficiency. This\nis made possible by the build-up of multiple threat datasets and threat\ndetection models, and more importantly, the design of realistic and\nsecurity-specific experiments.\n  We evaluate FL on two representative threat detection tasks, namely SMS spam\ndetection and Android malware detection. It shows that FL-trained detection\nmodels can achieve a performance that is comparable to centrally trained\ncounterparts. Also, most non-IID data distributions have either minor or\nnegligible impact on the model performance, while a label-based non-IID\ndistribution of a high extent can incur non-negligible fluctuation and delay in\nFL training. Then, under a realistic threat model, FL turns out to be\nadversary-resistant to attacks of both data poisoning and model poisoning.\nParticularly, the attacking impact of a practical data poisoning attack is no\nmore than 0.14\\% loss in model accuracy. Regarding FL efficiency, a\nbootstrapping strategy turns out to be effective to mitigate the training delay\nas observed in label-based non-IID scenarios.",

To curb key\nleakage issues and trace users in FE-IP, a new primitive called traceable\nfunctional encryption for inner product (TFE-IP) has been proposed. However,\nthe privacy protection of user's identities has not been considered in the\nexisting TFE-IP schemes. In order to balance privacy and accountability, we\npropose the concept of privacy-preserving traceable functional encryption for\ninner product (PPTFE-IP) and give a concrete construction. Our scheme provides\nthe following features: (1) To prevent key sharing, a user's key is bound with\nboth his/her identity and a vector; (2) The key generation center (KGC) and a\nuser execute a two-party secure computing protocol to generate a key without\nthe former knowing anything about the latter's identity; (3) Each user can\nverify the correctness of his/her key; (4) A user can calculate the inner\nproduct of the two vectors embedded in his/her key and in a ciphertext; (5)\nOnly the tracer can trace the identity embedded in a key.

    "summary" : "Machine learning has enhanced the performance of decoding signals indicating\nhuman behaviour. EEG decoding, as an exemplar indicating neural activity and\nhuman thoughts non-invasively, has been helpful in neural activity analysis and\naiding patients via brain-computer interfaces. However, training machine\nlearning algorithms on EEG encounters two primary challenges: variability\nacross data sets and privacy concerns using data from individuals and data\ncentres. Our objective is to address these challenges by integrating transfer\nlearning for data variability and federated learning for data privacy into a\nunified approach. We introduce the Sandwich as a novel deep privacy-preserving\nmeta-framework combining transfer learning and federated learning. The Sandwich\nframework comprises three components: federated networks (first layers) that\nhandle data set differences at the input level, a shared network (middle layer)\nlearning common rules and applying transfer learning, and individual\nclassifiers (final layers) for specific tasks of each data set. It enables the\ncentral network (central server) to benefit from multiple data sets, while\nlocal branches (local servers) maintain data and label privacy. We evaluated\nthe `Sandwich' meta-architecture in various configurations using the BEETL\nmotor imagery challenge, a benchmark for heterogeneous EEG data sets. Compared\nwith baseline models, our `Sandwich' implementations showed superior\nperformance. The best-performing model, the Inception Sandwich with deep set\nalignment (Inception-SD-Deepset), exceeded baseline methods by 9%. The\n`Sandwich' framework demonstrates significant advancements in federated deep\ntransfer learning for diverse tasks and data sets. It outperforms conventional\ndeep learning methods, showcasing the potential for effective use of larger,\nheterogeneous data sets with enhanced privacy as a model-agnostic\nmeta-framework.",

The challenge of encouraging mobile edge devices to participate\nzealously in FL model training procedures, while mitigating the privacy leakage\nrisks during wireless transmission, remains comparatively unexplored so far. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach, named QI-DPFL (Quality-Aware and\nIncentive-Boosted Federated Learning with Differential Privacy), to address the\naforementioned intractable issue. To select clients with high-quality datasets,\nwe first propose a quality-aware client selection mechanism based on the Earth\nMover's Distance (EMD) metric. Furthermore, to attract high-quality data\ncontributors, we design an incentive-boosted mechanism that constructs the\ninteractions between the central server and the selected clients as a two-stage\nStackelberg game, where the central server designs the time-dependent reward to\nminimize its cost by considering the trade-off between accuracy loss and total\nreward allocated, and each selected client decides the privacy budget to\nmaximize its utility.

We introduce Shatter, a novel DL\napproach in which nodes create virtual nodes (VNs) to disseminate chunks of\ntheir full model on their behalf. This enhances privacy by (i) preventing\nattackers from collecting full models from other nodes, and (ii) hiding the\nidentity of the original node that produced a given model chunk. We\ntheoretically prove the convergence of Shatter and provide a formal analysis\ndemonstrating how Shatter reduces the efficacy of attacks compared to when\nexchanging full models between participating nodes. We evaluate the convergence\nand attack resilience of Shatter with existing DL algorithms, with\nheterogeneous datasets, and against three standard privacy attacks, including\ngradient inversion.

    "summary" : "In this study, we introduce SpamDam, a SMS spam detection framework designed\nto overcome key challenges in detecting and understanding SMS spam, such as the\nlack of public SMS spam datasets, increasing privacy concerns of collecting SMS\ndata, and the need for adversary-resistant detection models. SpamDam comprises\nfour innovative modules: an SMS spam radar that identifies spam messages from\nonline social networks(OSNs); an SMS spam inspector for statistical analysis;\nSMS spam detectors(SSDs) that enable both central training and federated\nlearning; and an SSD analyzer that evaluates model resistance against\nadversaries in realistic scenarios. Leveraging SpamDam, we have compiled over\n76K SMS spam messages from Twitter and Weibo between 2018 and 2023, forming the\nlargest dataset of its kind. This dataset has enabled new insights into recent\nspam campaigns and the training of high-performing binary and multi-label\nclassifiers for spam detection. Furthermore, effectiveness of federated\nlearning has been well demonstrated to enable privacy-preserving SMS spam\ndetection. Additionally, we have rigorously tested the adversarial robustness\nof SMS spam detection models, introducing the novel reverse backdoor attack,\nwhich has shown effectiveness and stealthiness in practical tests.",

    "summary" : "The worldwide adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning models,\nparticularly in critical sectors, such as healthcare and finance, presents\nsubstantial challenges in maintaining individual privacy and fairness. These\ntwo elements are vital to a trustworthy environment for learning systems. While\nnumerous studies have concentrated on protecting individual privacy through\ndifferential privacy (DP) mechanisms, emerging research indicates that\ndifferential privacy in machine learning models can unequally impact separate\ndemographic subgroups regarding prediction accuracy. This leads to a fairness\nconcern, and manifests as biased performance. Although the prevailing view is\nthat enhancing privacy intensifies fairness disparities, a smaller, yet\nsignificant, subset of research suggests the opposite view. In this article,\nwith extensive evaluation results, we demonstrate that the impact of\ndifferential privacy on fairness is not monotonous. Instead, we observe that\nthe accuracy disparity initially grows as more DP noise (enhanced privacy) is\nadded to the ML process, but subsequently diminishes at higher privacy levels\nwith even more noise. Moreover, implementing gradient clipping in the\ndifferentially private stochastic gradient descent ML method can mitigate the\nnegative impact of DP noise on fairness. This mitigation is achieved by\nmoderating the disparity growth through a lower clipping threshold.",

    "summary" : "This work demonstrates two Privacy Policy (PP) summarisation models based on\ntwo different clustering algorithms: K-means clustering and Pre-determined\nCentroid (PDC) clustering. K-means is decided to be used for the first model\nafter an extensive evaluation of ten commonly used clustering algorithms. The\nsummariser model based on the PDC-clustering algorithm summarises PP documents\nby segregating individual sentences by Euclidean distance from each sentence to\nthe pre-defined cluster centres. The cluster centres are defined according to\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)'s 14 essential topics that must be\nincluded in any privacy notices. The PDC model outperformed the K-means model\nfor two evaluation methods, Sum of Squared Distance (SSD) and ROUGE by some\nmargin (27% and 24% respectively). This result contrasts the K-means model's\nbetter performance in the general clustering of sentence vectors before running\nthe task-specific evaluation. This indicates the effectiveness of operating\ntask-specific fine-tuning measures on unsupervised machine-learning models. The\nsummarisation mechanisms implemented in this paper demonstrates an idea of how\nto efficiently extract essential sentences that should be included in any PP\ndocuments.

To curb key\nleakage issues and trace users in FE-IP, a new primitive called traceable\nfunctional encryption for inner product (TFE-IP) has been proposed. However,\nthe privacy protection of user's identities has not been considered in the\nexisting TFE-IP schemes. In order to balance privacy and accountability, we\npropose the concept of privacy-preserving traceable functional encryption for\ninner product (PPTFE-IP) and give a concrete construction. Our scheme provides\nthe following features: (1) To prevent key sharing, a user's key is bound with\nboth his/her identity and a vector; (2) The key generation center (KGC) and a\nuser execute a two-party secure computing protocol to generate a key without\nthe former knowing anything about the latter's identity; (3) Each user can\nverify the correctness of his/her key; (4) A user can calculate the inner\nproduct of the two vectors embedded in his/her key and in a ciphertext; (5)\nOnly the tracer can trace the identity embedded in a key.

In this game, buyers with a high\nvaluation for a good have an incentive to keep their valuation private, lest\nthe seller charge them a higher price. This yields an equilibrium where some\nbuyers will send a signal that misrepresents their type with some probability;\nwe refer to this as buyer-induced privacy. When the seller is able to publicly\ncommit to providing a certain privacy level, we find that their equilibrium\nresponse is to commit to ignore buyers' signals with some positive probability;\nwe refer to this as seller-induced privacy. We then turn our attention to a\nrepeated interaction setting where the game parameters are unknown and the\nseller cannot credibly commit to a level of seller-induced privacy. In this\nsetting, players must learn strategies based on information revealed in past\nrounds. We find that, even without commitment ability, seller-induced privacy\narises as a result of reputation building. We characterize the resulting\nseller-induced privacy and seller's utility under no-regret and\nno-policy-regret learning algorithms and verify these results through\nsimulations.",

This paper presents\nan innovative approach to medical image classification, leveraging Federated\nLearning (FL) to address the dual challenges of data privacy and efficient\ndisease diagnosis. Traditional Centralized Machine Learning models, despite\ntheir widespread use in medical imaging for tasks such as disease diagnosis,\nraise significant privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of patient data.\nAs an alternative, FL emerges as a promising solution by allowing the training\nof a collective global model across local clients without centralizing the\ndata, thus preserving privacy. Focusing on the application of FL in Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) brain tumor detection, this study demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the Federated Learning framework coupled with EfficientNet-B0\nand the FedAvg algorithm in enhancing both privacy and diagnostic accuracy.\nThrough a meticulous selection of preprocessing methods, algorithms, and\nhyperparameters, and a comparative analysis of various Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) architectures, the research uncovers optimal strategies for image\nclassification. The experimental results reveal that EfficientNet-B0\noutperforms other models like ResNet in handling data heterogeneity and\nachieving higher accuracy and lower loss, highlighting the potential of FL in\novercoming the limitations of traditional models.

    "title" : "A Federated Learning Approach to Privacy Preserving Offensive Language\n  Identification",
    "summary" : "The spread of various forms of offensive speech online is an important\nconcern in social media. While platforms have been investing heavily in ways of\ncoping with this problem, the question of privacy remains largely unaddressed.\nModels trained to detect offensive language on social media are trained and/or\nfine-tuned using large amounts of data often stored in centralized servers.\nSince most social media data originates from end users, we propose a privacy\npreserving decentralized architecture for identifying offensive language online\nby introducing Federated Learning (FL) in the context of offensive language\nidentification. FL is a decentralized architecture that allows multiple models\nto be trained locally without the need for data sharing hence preserving users'\nprivacy. We propose a model fusion approach to perform FL. We trained multiple\ndeep learning models on four publicly available English benchmark datasets\n(AHSD, HASOC, HateXplain, OLID) and evaluated their performance in detail. We\nalso present initial cross-lingual experiments in English and Spanish. We show\nthat the proposed model fusion approach outperforms baselines in all the\ndatasets while preserving privacy.",

    "title" : "Real-Time Trajectory Synthesis with Local Differential Privacy",
    "summary" : "Trajectory streams are being generated from location-aware devices, such as\nsmartphones and in-vehicle navigation systems. Due to the sensitive nature of\nthe location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy\nleakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data\non the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising\nsolution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately,\nexisting stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal\ncontext information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility\nand limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn,\na novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform\non-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately\nextracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory\nanalysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy\nprotection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers\ninto consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components\nof RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update\nmechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct\nextensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets\nunder various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and\nhistorical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and\nversatility of our proposed framework.",

This paper studies the convergence\nproperties of these algorithms in a performative prediction setting, where the\ndata distribution may shift due to the deployed prediction model. For example,\nthe latter is caused by strategical users during the training of loan policy\nfor banks. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that the\nstraightforward implementation of a projected clipped SGD (PCSGD) algorithm may\nconverge to a biased solution compared to the performative stable solution. We\nquantify the lower and upper bound for the magnitude of the bias and\ndemonstrate a bias amplification phenomenon where the bias grows with the\nsensitivity of the data distribution. Second, we suggest two remedies to the\nbias amplification effect. The first one utilizes an optimal step size design\nfor PCSGD that takes the privacy guarantee into account. The second one uses\nthe recently proposed DiceSGD algorithm [Zhang et al., 2024]. We show that the\nlatter can successfully remove the bias and converge to the performative stable\nsolution.

    "summary" : "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify speakers' sentiment\ntendencies in multimodal video content, raising serious concerns about privacy\nrisks associated with multimodal data, such as voiceprints and facial images.\nRecent distributed collaborative learning has been verified as an effective\nparadigm for privacy preservation in multimodal tasks. However, they often\noverlook the privacy distinctions among different modalities, struggling to\nstrike a balance between performance and privacy preservation. Consequently, it\nposes an intriguing question of maximizing multimodal utilization to improve\nperformance while simultaneously protecting necessary modalities. This paper\nforms the first attempt at modality-specified (i.e., audio and visual) privacy\npreservation in MSA tasks. We propose a novel Hybrid Distributed cross-modality\ncGAN framework (HyDiscGAN), which learns multimodality alignment to generate\nfake audio and visual features conditioned on shareable de-identified textual\ndata. The objective is to leverage the fake features to approximate real audio\nand visual content to guarantee privacy preservation while effectively\nenhancing performance. Extensive experiments show that compared with the\nstate-of-the-art MSA model, HyDiscGAN can achieve superior or competitive\nperformance while preserving privacy.",
