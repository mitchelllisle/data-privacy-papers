    "title" : "Making Privacy-preserving Federated Graph Analytics with Strong\n  Guarantees Practical (for Certain Queries)",
    "summary" : "Privacy-preserving federated graph analytics is an emerging area of research.\nThe goal is to run graph analytics queries over a set of devices that are\norganized as a graph while keeping the raw data on the devices rather than\ncentralizing it. Further, no entity may learn any new information except for\nthe final query result. For instance, a device may not learn a neighbor's data.\nThe state-of-the-art prior work for this problem provides privacy guarantees\nfor a broad set of queries in a strong threat model where the devices can be\nmalicious. However, it imposes an impractical overhead: each device locally\nrequires over 8.79 hours of cpu time and 5.73 GiBs of network transfers per\nquery. This paper presents Colo, a new, low-cost system for privacy-preserving\nfederated graph analytics that requires minutes of cpu time and a few MiBs in\nnetwork transfers, for a particular subset of queries. At the heart of Colo is\na new secure computation protocol that enables a device to securely and\nefficiently evaluate a graph query in its local neighborhood while hiding\ndevice data, edge data, and topology data. An implementation and evaluation of\nColo shows that for running a variety of COVID-19 queries over a population of\n1M devices, it requires less than 8.4 minutes of a device's CPU time and 4.93\nMiBs in network transfers - improvements of up to three orders of magnitude.",

    "summary" : "With the increase in the number of privacy regulations, small development\nteams are forced to make privacy decisions on their own. In this paper, we\nconduct a mixed-method survey study, including statistical and qualitative\nanalysis, to evaluate the privacy perceptions, practices, and knowledge of\nmembers involved in various phases of software development (SDLC). Our survey\nincludes 362 participants from 23 countries, encompassing roles such as product\nmanagers, developers, and testers. Our results show diverse definitions of\nprivacy across SDLC roles, emphasizing the need for a holistic privacy approach\nthroughout SDLC. We find that software teams, regardless of their region, are\nless familiar with privacy concepts (such as anonymization), relying on\nself-teaching and forums. Most participants are more familiar with GDPR and\nHIPAA than other regulations, with multi-jurisdictional compliance being their\nprimary concern. Our results advocate the need for role-dependent solutions to\naddress the privacy challenges, and we highlight research directions and\neducational takeaways to help improve privacy-aware software development.",

First, we expand\nthe existing framework for collaborative dictionary learning (CollabDict),\nwhich has previously been limited to Gaussian mixture models, by incorporating\ndeep variational autoencoders (VAEs) into the framework, with a particular\nfocus on anomaly detection. We demonstrate that the VAE-based anomaly score\nfunction shares the same mathematical structure as the non-deep model, and\nprovide comprehensive qualitative comparison. Second, considering the\nwidespread use of \"pre-trained models,\" we provide a mathematical analysis on\ndata privacy leakage when models trained with CollabDict are shared externally.\nWe show that the CollabDict approach, when applied to Gaussian mixtures,\nadheres to a Renyi differential privacy criterion.

    "summary" : "It is commonplace to produce application-specific models by fine-tuning large\npre-trained models using a small bespoke dataset. The widespread availability\nof foundation model checkpoints on the web poses considerable risks, including\nthe vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we unveil a new\nvulnerability: the privacy backdoor attack. This black-box privacy attack aims\nto amplify the privacy leakage that arises when fine-tuning a model: when a\nvictim fine-tunes a backdoored model, their training data will be leaked at a\nsignificantly higher rate than if they had fine-tuned a typical model. We\nconduct extensive experiments on various datasets and models, including both\nvision-language models (CLIP) and large language models, demonstrating the\nbroad applicability and effectiveness of such an attack. Additionally, we carry\nout multiple ablation studies with different fine-tuning methods and inference\nstrategies to thoroughly analyze this new threat.

    "summary" : "Unsupervised (US) video anomaly detection (VAD) in surveillance applications\nis gaining more popularity recently due to its practical real-world\napplications. As surveillance videos are privacy sensitive and the availability\nof large-scale video data may enable better US-VAD systems, collaborative\nlearning can be highly rewarding in this setting. However, due to the extremely\nchallenging nature of the US-VAD task, where learning is carried out without\nany annotations, privacy-preserving collaborative learning of US-VAD systems\nhas not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a new baseline for anomaly\ndetection capable of localizing anomalous events in complex surveillance videos\nin a fully unsupervised fashion without any labels on a privacy-preserving\nparticipant-based distributed training configuration. Additionally, we propose\nthree new evaluation protocols to benchmark anomaly detection approaches on\nvarious scenarios of collaborations and data availability. Based on these\nprotocols, we modify existing VAD datasets to extensively evaluate our approach\nas well as existing US SOTA methods on two large-scale datasets including\nUCF-Crime and XD-Violence.

    "summary" : "In this study, we apply the information-theoretic Privacy Funnel (PF) model\nto the domain of face recognition, developing a novel method for\nprivacy-preserving representation learning within an end-to-end training\nframework. Our approach addresses the trade-off between obfuscation and utility\nin data protection, quantified through logarithmic loss, also known as\nself-information loss. This research provides a foundational exploration into\nthe integration of information-theoretic privacy principles with representation\nlearning, focusing specifically on the face recognition systems. We\nparticularly highlight the adaptability of our framework with recent\nadvancements in face recognition networks, such as AdaFace and ArcFace. In\naddition, we introduce the Generative Privacy Funnel ($\\mathsf{GenPF}$) model,\na paradigm that extends beyond the traditional scope of the PF model, referred\nto as the Discriminative Privacy Funnel ($\\mathsf{DisPF}$). This\n$\\mathsf{GenPF}$ model brings new perspectives on data generation methods with\nestimation-theoretic and information-theoretic privacy guarantees.\nComplementing these developments, we also present the deep variational PF\n(DVPF) model. This model proposes a tractable variational bound for measuring\ninformation leakage, enhancing the understanding of privacy preservation\nchallenges in deep representation learning. The DVPF model, associated with\nboth $\\mathsf{DisPF}$ and $\\mathsf{GenPF}$ models, sheds light on connections\nwith various generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion models. Complementing our\ntheoretical contributions, we release a reproducible PyTorch package,\nfacilitating further exploration and application of these privacy-preserving\nmethodologies in face recognition systems.",

Despite their great success, the knowledge\nprovided by the retrieval process is not always useful for improving the model\nprediction, since in some samples LLMs may already be quite knowledgeable and\nthus be able to answer the question correctly without retrieval. Aiming to save\nthe cost of retrieval, previous work has proposed to determine when to do/skip\nthe retrieval in a data-aware manner by analyzing the LLMs' pretraining data.\nHowever, these data-aware methods pose privacy risks and memory limitations,\nespecially when requiring access to sensitive or extensive pretraining data.\nMoreover, these methods offer limited adaptability under fine-tuning or\ncontinual learning settings. We hypothesize that token embeddings are able to\ncapture the model's intrinsic knowledge, which offers a safer and more\nstraightforward way to judge the need for retrieval without the privacy risks\nassociated with accessing pre-training data. Moreover, it alleviates the need\nto retain all the data utilized during model pre-training, necessitating only\nthe upkeep of the token embeddings.

    "summary" : "Image data have been extensively used in Deep Neural Network (DNN) tasks in\nvarious scenarios, e.g., autonomous driving and medical image analysis, which\nincurs significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy protection techniques are\nunable to efficiently protect such data. For example, Differential Privacy (DP)\nthat is an emerging technique protects data with strong privacy guarantee\ncannot effectively protect visual features of exposed image dataset. In this\npaper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving framework VisualMixer that\nprotects the training data of visual DNN tasks by pixel shuffling, while not\ninjecting any noises. VisualMixer utilizes a new privacy metric called Visual\nFeature Entropy (VFE) to effectively quantify the visual features of an image\nfrom both biological and machine vision aspects. In VisualMixer, we devise a\ntask-agnostic image obfuscation method to protect the visual privacy of data\nfor DNN training and inference. For each image, it determines regions for pixel\nshuffling in the image and the sizes of these regions according to the desired\nVFE. It shuffles pixels both in the spatial domain and in the chromatic channel\nspace in the regions without injecting noises so that it can prevent visual\nfeatures from being discerned and recognized, while incurring negligible\naccuracy loss. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that\nVisualMixer can effectively preserve the visual privacy with negligible\naccuracy loss, i.e., at average 2.35 percentage points of model accuracy loss,\nand almost no performance degradation on model training.",

    "summary" : "The notion of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy is a widely used concept of\nproviding quantifiable privacy to individuals. However, it is unclear how to\nexplain the level of privacy protection provided by a differential privacy\nmechanism with a set $\\varepsilon$. In this study, we focus on users'\ncomprehension of the privacy protection provided by a differential privacy\nmechanism. To do so, we study three variants of explaining the privacy\nprotection provided by differential privacy: (1) the original mathematical\ndefinition; (2) $\\varepsilon$ translated into a specific privacy risk; and (3)\nan explanation using the randomized response technique. We compare users'\ncomprehension of privacy protection employing these explanatory models with\ntheir comprehension of privacy protection of $k$-anonymity as baseline\ncomprehensibility. Our findings suggest that participants' comprehension of\ndifferential privacy protection is enhanced by the privacy risk model and the\nrandomized response-based model. Moreover, our results confirm our intuition\nthat privacy protection provided by $k$-anonymity is more comprehensible.",

    "summary" : "Time series have numerous applications in finance, healthcare, IoT, and smart\ncity. In many of these applications, time series typically contain personal\ndata, so privacy infringement may occur if they are released directly to the\npublic. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as the\nstate-of-the-art approach to protecting data privacy. However, existing works\non LDP-based collections cannot preserve the shape of time series. A recent\nwork, PatternLDP, attempts to address this problem, but it can only protect a\nfinite group of elements in a time series due to {\\omega}-event level privacy\nguarantee. In this paper, we propose PrivShape, a trie-based mechanism under\nuser-level LDP to protect all elements. PrivShape first transforms a time\nseries to reduce its length, and then adopts trie-expansion and two-level\nrefinement to improve utility. By extensive experiments on real-world datasets,\nwe demonstrate that PrivShape outperforms PatternLDP when adapted for offline\nuse, and can effectively extract frequent shapes.",

    "summary" : "gRPC is at the heart of modern distributed system architectures. Based on\nHTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, it provides highly performant, standardized, and\npolyglot communication across loosely coupled microservices and is increasingly\npreferred over REST- or GraphQL-based service APIs in practice. Despite its\nwidespread adoption, gRPC lacks any advanced privacy techniques beyond\ntransport encryption and basic token-based authentication. Such advanced\ntechniques are, however, increasingly important for fulfilling regulatory\nrequirements. For instance, anonymizing or otherwise minimizing (personal) data\nbefore responding to requests, or pre-processing data based on the purpose of\nthe access may be crucial in certain usecases. In this paper, we therefore\npropose a novel approach for integrating such advanced privacy techniques into\nthe gRPC framework in a practically viable way. Specifically, we present a\ngeneral approach along with a working prototype that implements privacy\ntechniques, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, in a\nconfigurable, extensible, and gRPC-native way utilizing a gRPC interceptor. We\nalso showcase how to integrate this contribution into a realistic example of a\nfood delivery use case.

To evaluate the SR performance, a metric\ntermed angular-domain peak-to-average ratio (ADPAR) is first defined and\nanalyzed.

    "summary" : "Despite achieving good performance and wide adoption, machine learning based\nsecurity detection models (e.g., malware classifiers) are subject to concept\ndrift and evasive evolution of attackers, which renders up-to-date threat data\nas a necessity. However, due to enforcement of various privacy protection\nregulations (e.g., GDPR), it is becoming increasingly challenging or even\nprohibitive for security vendors to collect individual-relevant and\nprivacy-sensitive threat datasets, e.g., SMS spam/non-spam messages from mobile\ndevices. To address such obstacles, this study systematically profiles the\n(in)feasibility of federated learning for privacy-preserving cyber threat\ndetection in terms of effectiveness, byzantine resilience, and efficiency. This\nis made possible by the build-up of multiple threat datasets and threat\ndetection models, and more importantly, the design of realistic and\nsecurity-specific experiments.\n  We evaluate FL on two representative threat detection tasks, namely SMS spam\ndetection and Android malware detection. It shows that FL-trained detection\nmodels can achieve a performance that is comparable to centrally trained\ncounterparts. Also, most non-IID data distributions have either minor or\nnegligible impact on the model performance, while a label-based non-IID\ndistribution of a high extent can incur non-negligible fluctuation and delay in\nFL training. Then, under a realistic threat model, FL turns out to be\nadversary-resistant to attacks of both data poisoning and model poisoning.\nParticularly, the attacking impact of a practical data poisoning attack is no\nmore than 0.14\\% loss in model accuracy. Regarding FL efficiency, a\nbootstrapping strategy turns out to be effective to mitigate the training delay\nas observed in label-based non-IID scenarios.",

To curb key\nleakage issues and trace users in FE-IP, a new primitive called traceable\nfunctional encryption for inner product (TFE-IP) has been proposed. However,\nthe privacy protection of user's identities has not been considered in the\nexisting TFE-IP schemes. In order to balance privacy and accountability, we\npropose the concept of privacy-preserving traceable functional encryption for\ninner product (PPTFE-IP) and give a concrete construction. Our scheme provides\nthe following features: (1) To prevent key sharing, a user's key is bound with\nboth his/her identity and a vector; (2) The key generation center (KGC) and a\nuser execute a two-party secure computing protocol to generate a key without\nthe former knowing anything about the latter's identity; (3) Each user can\nverify the correctness of his/her key; (4) A user can calculate the inner\nproduct of the two vectors embedded in his/her key and in a ciphertext; (5)\nOnly the tracer can trace the identity embedded in a key.

As a result, the sizes of these models have notably\nexpanded in recent years, persuading researchers to adopt the term large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to characterize the larger-sized PLMs. The increased\nsize is accompanied by a distinct capability known as in-context learning\n(ICL), which represents a specialized form of prompting. This enables the\nutilization of LLMs for specific downstream tasks by presenting them with\ndemonstration examples while keeping the model parameters frozen. Although\ninteresting, privacy concerns have become a major obstacle in its widespread\nusage. Multiple studies have examined the privacy risks linked to ICL and\nprompting in general, and have devised techniques to alleviate these risks.\nThus, there is a necessity to organize these mitigation techniques for the\nbenefit of the community. This survey provides a systematic overview of the\nprivacy protection methods employed during ICL and prompting in general. We\nreview, analyze, and compare different methods under this paradigm.\nFurthermore, we provide a summary of the resources accessible for the\ndevelopment of these frameworks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these\nframeworks and offer a detailed examination of the promising areas that\nnecessitate further exploration.",

    "summary" : "FemTech, a rising trend in mobile apps, empowers women to digitally manage\ntheir health and family planning. However, privacy and security vulnerabilities\nin period-tracking and fertility-monitoring apps present significant risks,\nsuch as unintended pregnancies and legal consequences. Our approach involves\nmanual observations of privacy policies and app permissions, along with dynamic\nand static analysis using multiple evaluation frameworks. Our research reveals\nthat many of these apps gather personally identifiable information (PII) and\nsensitive healthcare data. Furthermore, our analysis identifies that 61% of the\ncode vulnerabilities found in the apps are classified under the top-ten Open\nWeb Application Security Project (OWASP) vulnerabilities. Our research\nemphasizes the significance of tackling the privacy and security\nvulnerabilities present in period-tracking and fertility-monitoring mobile\napps. By highlighting these crucial risks, we aim to initiate a vital\ndiscussion and advocate for increased accountability and transparency of\ndigital tools for women's health. We encourage the industry to prioritize user\nprivacy and security, ultimately promoting a safer and more secure environment\nfor women's health management.",

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Using Deformable Operators for Secure\n  Task Learning",
    "summary" : "In the era of cloud computing and data-driven applications, it is crucial to\nprotect sensitive information to maintain data privacy, ensuring truly reliable\nsystems. As a result, preserving privacy in deep learning systems has become a\ncritical concern. Existing methods for privacy preservation rely on image\nencryption or perceptual transformation approaches. However, they often suffer\nfrom reduced task performance and high computational costs. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving framework that uses a set of\ndeformable operators for secure task learning. Our method involves shuffling\npixels during the analog-to-digital conversion process to generate visually\nprotected data. Those are then fed into a well-known network enhanced with\ndeformable operators. Using our approach, users can achieve equivalent\nperformance to original images without additional training using a secret key.\nMoreover, our method enables access control against unauthorized users.\nExperimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing its\npotential in cloud-based scenarios and privacy-sensitive applications.",

    "title" : "The 'Sandwich' meta-framework for architecture agnostic deep\n  privacy-preserving transfer learning for non-invasive brainwave decoding",
    "summary" : "Machine learning has enhanced the performance of decoding signals indicating\nhuman behaviour. EEG decoding, as an exemplar indicating neural activity and\nhuman thoughts non-invasively, has been helpful in neural activity analysis and\naiding patients via brain-computer interfaces. However, training machine\nlearning algorithms on EEG encounters two primary challenges: variability\nacross data sets and privacy concerns using data from individuals and data\ncentres. Our objective is to address these challenges by integrating transfer\nlearning for data variability and federated learning for data privacy into a\nunified approach. We introduce the Sandwich as a novel deep privacy-preserving\nmeta-framework combining transfer learning and federated learning. The Sandwich\nframework comprises three components: federated networks (first layers) that\nhandle data set differences at the input level, a shared network (middle layer)\nlearning common rules and applying transfer learning, and individual\nclassifiers (final layers) for specific tasks of each data set. It enables the\ncentral network (central server) to benefit from multiple data sets, while\nlocal branches (local servers) maintain data and label privacy. We evaluated\nthe `Sandwich' meta-architecture in various configurations using the BEETL\nmotor imagery challenge, a benchmark for heterogeneous EEG data sets. Compared\nwith baseline models, our `Sandwich' implementations showed superior\nperformance. The best-performing model, the Inception Sandwich with deep set\nalignment (Inception-SD-Deepset), exceeded baseline methods by 9%. The\n`Sandwich' framework demonstrates significant advancements in federated deep\ntransfer learning for diverse tasks and data sets. It outperforms conventional\ndeep learning methods, showcasing the potential for effective use of larger,\nheterogeneous data sets with enhanced privacy as a model-agnostic\nmeta-framework.",

    "summary" : "The rise in IoT-driven distributed data analytics, coupled with increasing\nprivacy concerns, has led to a demand for effective privacy-preserving and\nfederated data collection/model training mechanisms. In response, approaches\nsuch as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been\nproposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they\nstill share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks\nwherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. poisoned)\ndata to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results.\n  In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based\non a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for\nIoT/embedded devices' software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a\nSystem-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity\nsecurity features of embedded devices - in particular ARM TrustZoneM security\nextensions - to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part\nof FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security\nguarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes\nfeaturing multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes,\nshowcases SLAPP's security and low overhead.",

    "summary" : "Banks publish daily a list of available securities/assets (axe list) to\nselected clients to help them effectively locate Long (buy) or Short (sell)\ntrades at reduced financing rates. This reduces costs for the bank, as the list\naggregates the bank's internal firm inventory per asset for all clients of long\nas well as short trades. However, this is somewhat problematic: (1) the bank's\ninventory is revealed; (2) trades of clients who contribute to the aggregated\nlist, particularly those deemed large, are revealed to other clients. Clients\nconducting sizable trades with the bank and possessing a portion of the\naggregated asset exceeding $50\\%$ are considered to be concentrated clients.\nThis could potentially reveal a trading concentrated client's activity to their\ncompetitors, thus providing an unfair advantage over the market.\n  Atlas-X Axe Obfuscation, powered by new differential private methods, enables\na bank to obfuscate its published axe list on a daily basis while under\ncontinual observation, thus maintaining an acceptable inventory Profit and Loss\n(P&L) cost pertaining to the noisy obfuscated axe list while reducing the\nclients' trading activity leakage. Our main differential private innovation is\na differential private aggregator for streams (time series data) of both\npositive and negative integers under continual observation.\n  For the last two years, Atlas-X system has been live in production across\nthree major regions-USA, Europe, and Asia-at J.P. Morgan, a major financial\ninstitution, facilitating significant profitability. To our knowledge, it is\nthe first differential privacy solution to be deployed in the financial sector.\nWe also report benchmarks of our algorithm based on (anonymous) real and\nsynthetic data to showcase the quality of our obfuscation and its success in\nproduction.",
