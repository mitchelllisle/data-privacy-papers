    "title" : "Empowering Manufacturers with Privacy-Preserving AI Tools: A Case Study\n  in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning to Solve Real-World Problems",
    "summary" : "Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because\nof competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their\nproprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This\npaper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may\nsafely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those\nresearchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world\nproblems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform\nfor others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate\nthis problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem\nin the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality\ncontrol relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals\nin the images were manually counted, which required substantial and\ntime-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal\nanalysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool\nenables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers\nfrom microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample\npreparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high\nresolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also\ndeveloped to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged\nfor real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the\noriginating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while\nkeeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process,\nfuture directions are also explored.",

    "title" : "Tuning without Peeking: Provable Privacy and Generalization Bounds for\n  LLM Post-Training",
    "summary" : "Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering\nefficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong\ntheoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to\ndata poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates\non top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement\nsuitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in\naddition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we\ndemonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing\nhow a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a\nbenchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on\non top of gradient-based optimization.",

    "summary" : "Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet\nof Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often\nproduce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data\ncollection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising\nsolutions by capturing indoor environment variations.

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a\nFederated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a\nDeep Neural Network (DNN) model.

    "summary" : "There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by\non-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data\nand the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted\nmethods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local\nmobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation\ntransmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the\nserver. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and\nefficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via\nserver-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and\nimprove computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the\nserver side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves\nthe mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring\ndata samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a\none-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a\nsingle activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the\nside network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive\nadapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules\nbased on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth\nlabels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network\ncomputing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.",

    "summary" : "Local differential privacy (LDP) provides a rigorous and quantifiable privacy\nguarantee for personal data by introducing perturbation at the data source.\nHowever, quantifying the impact of these perturbations on classifier utility\nremains a theoretical challenge, particularly for complex or black-box\nclassifiers.\n  This paper presents a framework for theoretically quantifying classifier\nutility under LDP mechanisms. The key insight is that LDP perturbation is\nconcentrated around the original data with a specific probability, transforming\nutility analysis of the classifier into its robustness analysis in this\nconcentrated region. Our framework connects the concentration analysis of LDP\nmechanisms with the robustness analysis of classifiers. It treats LDP\nmechanisms as general distributional functions and classifiers as black-box\nfunctions, thus applicable to any LDP mechanism and classifier. A direct\napplication of our utility quantification is guiding the selection of LDP\nmechanisms and privacy parameters for a given classifier. Notably, our analysis\nshows that a piecewise-based mechanism leads to better utility compared to\nalternatives in common scenarios.\n  Using this framework alongside two novel refinement techniques, we conduct\ncase studies on utility quantification for typical mechanism-classifier\ncombinations.

    "summary" : "Major advertising platforms recently increased privacy protections by\nlimiting advertisers' access to individual-level data. Instead of providing\naccess to granular raw data, the platforms only allow a limited number of\naggregate queries to a dataset, which is further protected by adding\ndifferentially private noise. This paper studies whether and how advertisers\ncan design effective targeting policies within these restrictive privacy\npreserving data environments. To achieve this, I develop a probabilistic\nmachine learning method based on Bayesian optimization, which facilitates\ndynamic data exploration. Since Bayesian optimization was designed to sample\npoints from a function to find its maximum, it is not applicable to aggregate\nqueries and to targeting. Therefore, I introduce two innovations: (i) integral\nupdating of posteriors which allows to select the best regions of the data to\nquery rather than individual points and (ii) a targeting-aware acquisition\nfunction that dynamically selects the most informative regions for the\ntargeting task. I identify the conditions of the dataset and privacy\nenvironment that necessitate the use of such a \"smart\" querying strategy. I\napply the strategic querying method to the Criteo AI Labs dataset for uplift\nmodeling (Diemert et al., 2018) that contains visit and conversion data from\n14M users. I show that an intuitive benchmark strategy only achieves 33% of the\nnon-privacy-preserving targeting potential in some cases, while my strategic\nquerying method achieves 97-101% of that potential, and is statistically\nindistinguishable from Causal Forest (Athey et al., 2019): a state-of-the-art\nnon-privacy-preserving machine learning targeting method.",

Through empirical\nevaluation on four heterogeneous data sets protected with $k$-anonymity and\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy as privacy models, our approach demonstrates\nutility and forgetting effectiveness comparable to those of exact unlearning\nmethods, while significantly reducing computational and storage costs.

    "title" : "Towards integration of Privacy Enhancing Technologies in Explainable\n  Artificial Intelligence",
    "summary" : "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating\nthe risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI\nmethods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in\ntraining or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks\nthat exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of\nindividuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy\nattacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and\nmachine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we\nexplore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against\nattribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We\nempirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,\ndifferentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of\nfeature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the\nmitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as\nutility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations\nreduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and\nexplanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using\nPETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy\nattack on sensitive personal information.",

    "title" : "From Legal Text to Tech Specs: Generative AI's Interpretation of Consent\n  in Privacy Law",
    "summary" : "Privacy law and regulation have turned to \"consent\" as the legitimate basis\nfor collecting and processing individuals' data. As governments have rushed to\nenshrine consent requirements in their privacy laws, such as the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), significant challenges remain in understanding how\nthese legal mandates are operationalized in software. The opaque nature of\nsoftware development processes further complicates this translation. To address\nthis, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in requirements\nengineering to bridge the gap between legal requirements and technical\nimplementation. This study employs a three-step pipeline that involves using an\nLLM to classify software use cases for compliance, generating LLM modifications\nfor non-compliant cases, and manually validating these changes against legal\nstandards. Our preliminary findings highlight the potential of LLMs in\nautomating compliance tasks, while also revealing limitations in their\nreasoning capabilities. By benchmarking LLMs against real-world use cases, this\nresearch provides insights into leveraging AI-driven solutions to enhance legal\ncompliance of software.",

    "summary" : "Privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) seeks to balance data utility and\nprivacy, especially as regulations like the GDPR mandate the anonymization of\npersonal data for ML applications. Conventional anonymization approaches often\nreduce data utility due to indiscriminate generalization or suppression of data\nattributes. In this study, we propose an interactive approach that incorporates\nhuman input into the k-anonymization process, enabling domain experts to guide\nattribute preservation based on contextual importance. Using the UCI Adult\ndataset, we compare classification outcomes of interactive human-influenced\nanonymization with traditional, fully automated methods. Our results show that\nhuman input can enhance data utility in some cases, although results vary\nacross tasks and settings. We discuss limitations of our approach and suggest\npotential areas for improved interactive frameworks in privacy-aware ML.",

    "summary" : "This work presents a novel decentralized protocol for digital estate planning\nthat integrates advances distributed computing, and cryptography. The original\nproof-of-concept was constructed using purely solidity contracts. Since then,\nwe have enhanced the implementation into a layer-1 protocol that uses modern\ninterchain communication to connect several heterogeneous chain types. A key\ncontribution of this research is the implementation of several modern\ncryptographic primitives to support various forms of claims for information\nvalidation. These primitives introduce an unmatched level of privacy to the\nprocess of digital inheritance. We also demonstrate on a set of heterogeneous\nsmart contracts, following the same spec, on each chain to serve as entry\npoints, gateways, or bridge contracts that are invoked via a path from the will\nmodule on our protocol, to the contract. This ensures a fair and secure\ndistribution of digital assets in accordance with the wishes of the decedent\nwithout the requirement of moving their funds. This research further extends\nits innovations with a user interaction model, featuring a check-in system and\naccount abstraction process, which enhances flexibility and user-friendliness\nwithout compromising on security. By developing a dedicated permissionless\nblockchain that is secured by a network of validators, and interchain relayers,\nthe proposed protocol signifies a transformation in the digital estate planning\nindustry and illustrates the potential of blockchain technology in\nrevolutionizing traditional legal and personal spheres. Implementing a\ncryptoeconomic network at the core of inheritance planning allows for unique\nincentive compatible economic mechanisms to be constructed.",

    "title" : "Preserving Privacy, Increasing Accessibility, and Reducing Cost: An\n  On-Device Artificial Intelligence Model for Medical Transcription and Note\n  Generation",
    "summary" : "Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for\nhealthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on\nadministrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer\npromising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit\ntheir adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI\nadoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility\nfor resource-constrained environments.",
