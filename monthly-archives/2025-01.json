    "title" : "Privacy Preservation in MIMO-OFDM Localization Systems: A Beamforming\n  Approach",
    "summary" : "We investigate an uplink MIMO-OFDM localization scenario where a legitimate\nbase station (BS) aims to localize a user equipment (UE) using pilot signals\ntransmitted by the UE, while an unauthorized BS attempts to localize the UE by\neavesdropping on these pilots, posing a risk to the UE's location privacy. To\nenhance legitimate localization performance while protecting the UE's privacy,\nwe formulate an optimization problem regarding the beamformers at the UE,\naiming to minimize the Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for legitimate localization\nwhile constraining the CRB for unauthorized localization above a threshold. A\npenalty dual decomposition optimization framework is employed to solve the\nproblem, leading to a novel beamforming approach for location privacy\npreservation. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach and demonstrate its superiority over existing benchmarks.",

    "title" : "Privacy Bills of Materials: A Transparent Privacy Information Inventory\n  for Collaborative Privacy Notice Generation in Mobile App Development",
    "summary" : "Privacy regulations mandate that developers must provide authentic and\ncomprehensive privacy notices, e.g., privacy policies or labels, to inform\nusers of their apps' privacy practices. However, due to a lack of knowledge of\nprivacy requirements, developers often struggle to create accurate privacy\nnotices, especially for sophisticated mobile apps with complex features and in\ncrowded development teams. To address these challenges, we introduce Privacy\nBills of Materials (PriBOM), a systematic software engineering approach that\nleverages different development team roles to better capture and coordinate\nmobile app privacy information. PriBOM facilitates transparency-centric privacy\ndocumentation and specific privacy notice creation, enabling traceability and\ntrackability of privacy practices. We present a pre-fill of PriBOM based on\nstatic analysis and privacy notice analysis techniques. We demonstrate the\nperceived usefulness of PriBOM through a human evaluation with 150 diverse\nparticipants. Our findings suggest that PriBOM could serve as a significant\nsolution for providing privacy support in DevOps for mobile apps.",

    "title" : "Information Sifting Funnel: Privacy-preserving Collaborative Inference\n  Against Model Inversion Attacks",
    "summary" : "The complexity of neural networks and inference tasks, coupled with demands\nfor computational efficiency and real-time feedback, poses significant\nchallenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Collaborative inference\nmitigates this by assigning shallow feature extraction to edge devices and\noffloading features to the cloud for further inference, reducing computational\nload. However, transmitted features remain susceptible to model inversion\nattacks (MIAs), which can reconstruct original input data. Current defenses,\nsuch as perturbation and information bottleneck techniques, offer explainable\nprotection but face limitations, including the lack of standardized criteria\nfor assessing MIA difficulty, challenges in mutual information estimation, and\ntrade-offs among usability, privacy, and deployability.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce the first criterion to evaluate MIA\ndifficulty in collaborative inference, supported by theoretical analysis of\nexisting attacks and defenses, validated using experiments with the Mutual\nInformation Neural Estimator (MINE). Based on these findings, we propose\nSiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative inference. The\nedge model is trained with linear and non-linear correlation constraints to\nreduce redundant information in transmitted features, enhancing privacy\nprotection. Label smoothing and a cloud-based upsampling module are added to\nbalance usability and privacy. To improve deployability, the edge model\nincorporates a funnel-shaped structure and attention mechanisms, preserving\nboth privacy and usability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiftFunnel\noutperforms state-of-the-art defenses against MIAs, achieving superior privacy\nprotection with less than 3% accuracy loss and striking an optimal balance\namong usability, privacy, and practicality.",
