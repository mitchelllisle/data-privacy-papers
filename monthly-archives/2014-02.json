[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3757v3","title":"On the Relation Between Identifiability, Differential Privacy and Mutual-Information Privacy","summary":"This paper investigates the relation between three different notions of privacy: identifiability, differential privacy and mutual-information privacy. Under a unified privacy-distortion framework, where the distortion is defined to be the Hamming distance of the input and output databases, we establish some fundamental connections between these three privacy notions. Given a distortion level $D$, define $ε_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest (best) identifiability level, and $ε_{\\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest differential privacy level. We characterize $ε_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ and $ε_{\\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$, and prove that $ε_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)-ε_X\\leε_{\\mathrm{d}}^*(D)\\leε_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ for $D$ in some range, where $ε_X$ is a constant depending on the distribution of the original database $X$, and diminishes to zero when the distribution of $X$ is uniform. Furthermore, we show that identifiability and mutual-information privacy are consistent in the sense that given distortion level $D$, the mechanism that optimizes the mutual-information privacy also minimizes the identifiability level.","updated":"2015-08-25T00:03:13Z","published":"2014-02-16T05:43:33Z","authors":[{"name":"Weina Wang"},{"name":"Lei Ying"},{"name":"Junshan Zhang"}],"categories":["cs.CR"]}]
