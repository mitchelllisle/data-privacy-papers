    "title" : "Privacy by Design for Self-Sovereign Identity Systems: An in-depth\n  Component Analysis completed by a Design Assistance Dashboard",
    "summary" : "The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems for digital identity\nmanagement is gaining traction and interest. Countries such as Bhutan have\nalready implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their\ncitizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door\nfor SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity\nwallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise\nquestions about individual privacy.\n  The purpose of this article is to help SSI solution designers make informed\nchoices to ensure that the designed solution is privacy-friendly. The\nobservation is that the range of possible solutions is very broad, from DID and\nDID resolution methods to verifiable credential types, publicly available\ninformation (e.g. in a blockchain), type of infrastructure, etc. As a result,\nthe article proposes (1) to group the elementary building blocks of a SSI\nsystem into 5 structuring layers, (2) to analyze for each layer the privacy\nimplications of using the chosen building block, and (3) to provide a design\nassistance dashboard that gives the complete picture of the SSI, and shows the\ninterdependencies between architectural choices and technical building blocks,\nallowing designers to make informed choices and graphically achieve a SSI\nsolution that meets their need for privacy.",

    "title" : "Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models",
    "summary" : "Image autoregressive (IAR) models have surpassed diffusion models (DMs) in\nboth image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) and generation speed. However, their\nprivacy risks remain largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a\ncomprehensive privacy analysis comparing IARs to DMs. We develop a novel\nmembership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a significantly higher success\nrate in detecting training images (TPR@FPR=1%: 86.38% for IARs vs. 4.91% for\nDMs). Using this MIA, we perform dataset inference (DI) and find that IARs\nrequire as few as six samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 for\nDMs, indicating higher information leakage. Additionally, we extract hundreds\nof training images from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our findings highlight\na fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in generation quality\nand speed, they are significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks. This\nsuggests that incorporating techniques from DMs, such as per-token probability\nmodeling using diffusion, could help mitigate IARs' privacy risks.

    "title" : "Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially\n  Private Time Series Forecasting",
    "summary" : "Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital\noccupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine\nlearning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such\nas individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient\ndescent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees\nof DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting,\nsince they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small,\nunstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches\nfor forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time\nseries from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series,\nand (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We\ntheoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured\nsubsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight\nevent- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we\nadditionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised\ntraining of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that\namplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting\nmodels with strong formal privacy guarantees.",

    "title" : "Common Neighborhood Estimation over Bipartite Graphs under Local\n  Differential Privacy",
    "summary" : "Bipartite graphs, formed by two vertex layers, arise as a natural fit for\nmodeling the relationships between two groups of entities. In bipartite graphs,\ncommon neighborhood computation between two vertices on the same vertex layer\nis a basic operator, which is easily solvable in general settings. However, it\ninevitably involves releasing the neighborhood information of vertices, posing\na significant privacy risk for users in real-world applications. To protect\nedge privacy in bipartite graphs, in this paper, we study the problem of\nestimating the number of common neighbors of two vertices on the same layer\nunder edge local differential privacy (edge LDP). The problem is challenging in\nthe context of edge LDP since each vertex on the opposite layer of the query\nvertices can potentially be a common neighbor. To obtain efficient and accurate\nestimates, we propose a multiple-round framework that significantly reduces the\ncandidate pool of common neighbors and enables the query vertices to construct\nunbiased estimators locally. Furthermore, we improve data utility by\nincorporating the estimators built from the neighbors of both query vertices\nand devise privacy budget allocation optimizations. These improve the\nestimator's robustness and consistency, particularly against query vertices\nwith imbalanced degrees. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques.",

    "summary" : "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived\nfunctional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding\nneurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the\ngeneralizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy\nregulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed)\nproperty of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose\nDomain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning\nframework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site\nsettings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement,\ndecomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific\ncomponents, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data\nspecificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge\ntransfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning\nmodule enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We\nevaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its\ngeneralizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior\nclassification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an\nenhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional\nconnectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively,\nuncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings\nhighlight the potential of DAFed to advance multi-site collaborative research\nin neuroimaging while protecting data confidentiality.",

    "summary" : "Federated learning is a distributed learning technique that allows training a\nglobal model with the participation of different data owners without the need\nto share raw data. This architecture is orchestrated by a central server that\naggregates the local models from the clients. This server may be trusted, but\nnot all nodes in the network. Then, differential privacy (DP) can be used to\nprivatize the global model by adding noise. However, this may affect\nconvergence across the rounds of the federated architecture, depending also on\nthe aggregation strategy employed. In this work, we aim to introduce the notion\nof metric-privacy to mitigate the impact of classical server side global-DP on\nthe convergence of the aggregated model. Metric-privacy is a relaxation of DP,\nsuitable for domains provided with a notion of distance. We apply it from the\nserver side by computing a distance for the difference between the local\nmodels. We compare our approach with standard DP by analyzing the impact on six\nclassical aggregation strategies. The proposed methodology is applied to an\nexample of medical imaging and different scenarios are simulated across\nhomogeneous and non-i.i.d clients. Finally, we introduce a novel client\ninference attack, where a semi-honest client tries to find whether another\nclient participated in the training and study how it can be mitigated using DP\nand metric-privacy. Our evaluation shows that metric-privacy can increase the\nperformance of the model compared to standard DP, while offering similar\nprotection against client inference attacks.",

Although these models are assumed to\nprotect sensitive information in their training data, the extent to which this\nassumption holds for different architectures remains unexplored. This\nassumption is challenged by inversion attacks which attempt to reconstruct\ntraining data from model weights, exposing significant privacy vulnerabilities.\nIn this study, we systematically evaluate the privacy-preserving properties of\nvision classifiers across diverse architectures, including Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Vision\nTransformers (ViTs).

    "summary" : "Mental illness is a widespread and debilitating condition with substantial\nsocietal and personal costs. Traditional diagnostic and treatment approaches,\nsuch as self-reported questionnaires and psychotherapy sessions, often impose\nsignificant burdens on both patients and clinicians, limiting accessibility and\nefficiency. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in\nNatural Language Processing and multimodal techniques, hold great potential for\nrecognizing and addressing conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, privacy\nconcerns, including the risk of sensitive data leakage from datasets and\ntrained models, remain a critical barrier to deploying these AI systems in\nreal-world clinical settings. These challenges are amplified in multimodal\nmethods, where personal identifiers such as voice and facial data can be\nmisused. This paper presents a critical and comprehensive study of the privacy\nchallenges associated with developing and deploying AI models for mental\nhealth. We further prescribe potential solutions, including data anonymization,\nsynthetic data generation, and privacy-preserving model training, to strengthen\nprivacy safeguards in practical applications. Additionally, we discuss\nevaluation frameworks to assess the privacy-utility trade-offs in these\napproaches. By addressing these challenges, our work aims to advance the\ndevelopment of reliable, privacy-aware AI tools to support clinical\ndecision-making and improve mental health outcomes.",
