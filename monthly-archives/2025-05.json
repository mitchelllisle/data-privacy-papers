    "title" : "A Novel Feature-Aware Chaotic Image Encryption Scheme For Data Security\n  and Privacy in IoT and Edge Networks",
    "summary" : "The security of image data in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks\nis crucial due to the increasing deployment of intelligent systems for\nreal-time decision-making. Traditional encryption algorithms such as AES and\nRSA are computationally expensive for resource-constrained IoT devices and\nineffective for large-volume image data, leading to inefficiencies in\nprivacy-preserving distributed learning applications. To address these\nconcerns, this paper proposes a novel Feature-Aware Chaotic Image Encryption\nscheme that integrates Feature-Aware Pixel Segmentation (FAPS) with Chaotic\nChain Permutation and Confusion mechanisms to enhance security while\nmaintaining efficiency. The proposed scheme consists of three stages: (1) FAPS,\nwhich extracts and reorganizes pixels based on high and low edge intensity\nfeatures for correlation disruption; (2) Chaotic Chain Permutation, which\nemploys a logistic chaotic map with SHA-256-based dynamically updated keys for\nblock-wise permutation; and (3) Chaotic chain Confusion, which utilises\ndynamically generated chaotic seed matrices for bitwise XOR operations.\nExtensive security and performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed\nscheme significantly reduces pixel correlation -- almost zero, achieves high\nentropy values close to 8, and resists differential cryptographic attacks. The\noptimum design of the proposed scheme makes it suitable for real-time\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments.",

    "title" : "Graph Privacy: A Heterogeneous Federated GNN for Trans-Border Financial\n  Data Circulation",
    "summary" : "The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial\ninstitutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of\ninterconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To\neffectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow\nand sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize\nthe joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations\nin different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural\nNetwork (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous\nbusiness data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the\nsharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a\nstatistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each\nsubgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local\ntraining to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated\nparameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature\ninformation among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show\nthat the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence\nspeed than existing methods.",
