    "title" : "Evaluating the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Generating\n  Fine-Grained Visual Privacy Policies in Homes",
    "summary" : "The proliferation of visual sensors in smart home environments, particularly\nthrough wearable devices like smart glasses, introduces profound privacy\nchallenges. Existing privacy controls are often static and coarse-grained,\nfailing to accommodate the dynamic and socially nuanced nature of home\nenvironments. This paper investigates the viability of using Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as the core of a dynamic and adaptive privacy policy engine. We\npropose a conceptual framework where visual data is classified using a\nmulti-dimensional schema that considers data sensitivity, spatial context, and\nsocial presence. An LLM then reasons over this contextual information to\nenforce fine-grained privacy rules, such as selective object obfuscation, in\nreal-time. Through a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art Vision Language\nModels (including GPT-4o and the Qwen-VL series) in simulated home settings ,\nour findings show the feasibility of this approach. The LLM-based engine\nachieved a top machine-evaluated appropriateness score of 3.99 out of 5, and\nthe policies generated by the models received a top human-evaluated score of\n4.00 out of 5.",

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Driver Drowsiness Detection with Spatial\n  Self-Attention and Federated Learning",
    "summary" : "Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is\nrecognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,\ndetecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in\nreal-world settings where facial data from different individuals is\ndecentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nfor drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with\nheterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial\nSelf-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetwork to better extract key facial features and improve detection\nperformance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity\nComparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different\noperators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the\nglobal model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool\nthat automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and\ncropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,\nflipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that\nour framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning\nsettings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling\nreal-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in\nintelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and\nreliable drowsiness detection.",

    "summary" : "Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pok\\'emon Go,\nstream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user\nexperiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious\nprivacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging\nthan in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time\nlocation protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy\nguaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS).\nExisting methods fail to meet these combined demands.\n  To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework\nfor real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar\nStaircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to\ngenerate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected\nerror; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme\nthat releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a\nprivate threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level\nprivacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and\nvalidate PrivAR on a Pok\\'emon-Go-style prototype.

This study presents the\nfirst real-world experimental evaluation of three post-quantum secure HE\nschemes, i.e., Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan\n(BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), for vehicular communication scenarios.\nTwo representative privacy-preserving use cases are considered: encrypted\nvehicle counting and average speed aggregation. Experiments are conducted over\nboth Wi-Fi and Ethernet to assess performance under wireless and wired\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) settings. Results show that BFV and BGV are\nsuitable for latency-tolerant applications such as intersection monitoring and\nregional traffic analysis, with total end-to-end latencies under 10 seconds.\nWhile CKKS experiences higher overhead, it remains viable for periodic\nencrypted aggregation of numerical data. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat HE can be feasibly deployed in ITS environments under 128-bit post-quantum\nsecurity, provided that scheme-specific latency constraints are considered.\nThis reinforces its potential to serve as a foundational tool for secure and\nprivacy-preserving V2X data processing.",

    "summary" : "Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale\nimage retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like\nClearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a\nlarge amount of online content associated with that person. This not only\nenables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as\nsocial media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their\nconsent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a\nuser-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such\nretrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial\nsignatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically\ndeformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of\nany facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by\na critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of\nFR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.\nExperiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a\nwide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing\nmethods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video\nsettings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,\nProtego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance\nand unsolicited identity tracing.",

    "summary" : "Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance\nquality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless\ncommunication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to\nthat of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching\nmethods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper\nsystem performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based\noptimization approaches.",

To\nmitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,\nDataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage\nefficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with\nDP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without\ncompromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods\nsuffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on\nnoisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the\ninefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive\nnoise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples\nsampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality\nby mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative\nsubspace.

    "summary" : "With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in\nprivacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,\nensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party\ncomputation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from\nhigh communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the\nexpensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a\npromising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision\ninteger computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing\nMPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization\nparameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in\nhandling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we\npropose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight\nfully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup\ntable protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we\nuse dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup\ntables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on\nBERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\\times$\nspeedup compared to Lu \\emph{et al}.

    "title" : "Lifelong Person Re-identification via Privacy-Preserving Data Replay",
    "summary" : "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate\nknowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy\neffectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused\nby domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the\nproposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving\ndata privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on\nsequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other\nreplay-based methods, respectively.",

    "title" : "Open Data Sharing in Clinical Research and Participants Privacy:\n  Challenges and Opportunities in the Era of Artificial Intelligence",
    "summary" : "Sharing clinical research data is key for increasing the pace of medical\ndiscoveries that improve human health. However, concern about study\nparticipants' privacy, confidentiality, and safety is a major factor that\ndeters researchers from openly sharing clinical data, even after\ndeidentification. This concern is further heightened by the evolution of\nartificial intelligence (AI) approaches that pose an ever-increasing threat to\nthe reidentification of study participants. Here, we discuss the challenges AI\napproaches create that blur the lines between identifiable and non-identifiable\ndata. We present a concept of pseudo-reidentification, and discuss how these\nchallenges provide opportunities for rethinking open data sharing practices in\nclinical research. We highlight the novel open data sharing approach we have\nestablished as part of the Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas\nfor Diabetes Insights project, one of the four Data Generation Projects funded\nby the National Institutes of Health Common Fund's Bridge2AI Program.",

    "summary" : "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable\nability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a\nsubstantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a\npotential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often\nperform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may\nintroduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose\nGeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy\nprotection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a\nfeature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical\ninformation, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints\ngeo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module\nthat jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure\neffectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging\nbenchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in\nblack-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on\nvisual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore\nadversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by\nadvanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating\nprivacy concerns.",

    "summary" : "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.\nHowever, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are\nsusceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information\nthrough generated responses.

PAD integrates confidence-based\nscreening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity\nestimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration\nto balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)\naccountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit\nper-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.\nUnlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is\nmodel-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

To demonstrate this methodology, we\nfocus on PETs supporting client-server applications as they are the simplest to\ndeploy. In particular, we measure the energy consumption and carbon footprint\nincrease induced by five cryptographic PETs (compared to their non-private\nequivalent): HTTPS web browsing, encrypted machine learning (ML) inference,\nencrypted ML training, encrypted databases, and encrypted emails. Our findings\nreveal significant variability in carbon footprint increases, ranging from a\ntwofold increase in HTTPS web browsing to a 100,000-fold increase in encrypted\nML.\n  Our study provides essential data to help decision-makers assess\nprivacy-carbon trade-offs in such applications.

    "summary" : "User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy\npreferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over\ntime. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously\ncollect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user\nbehaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,\nfew-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify\nand modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive\n(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).\nLeveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU\nsensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding\nspace, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a\nprivacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided\nactivity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the\noriginal data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a\nnon-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity\nrecognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.",

As bandit algorithms\nare increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes\ncritical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision\nrounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in\nbandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved\nsimultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit\nalgorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas\nfairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes\ninequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound\n(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,\nmatching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is\nsufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential\nprivacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time\nhorizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic\nbandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret\nthan state-of-the-art baselines.

Distance, a critical factor in graph analysis, is typically handled\nusing curator DP, where a trusted curator holds the complete neighbor lists of\nall vertices and answers queries privately. However, in many real-world\nscenarios, such a curator may not be present, posing a significant challenge\nfor implementing differentially private distance queries under Local\nDifferential Privacy (LDP). This paper proposes two approaches to address this\nchallenge. The first approach generates a synthetic graph by randomizing\nresponses and applies bitwise operations to reduce noise interference. However,\nlike other synthetic graph methods, this approach suffers from low utility. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a second approach, the first LDP method\nspecifically designed for distance queries, which captures the global graph\nstructure by continuously aggregating local distance vectors from neighboring\nvertices. This process enables the accurate updating of global distances.

    "title" : "Privacy Disclosure of Similarity in Speech and Language Processing",
    "summary" : "Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often\ncompare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the\nidentity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be\ninaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as\nthe most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate\nsimilarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We\npropose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a\nsimilarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on\ndetermining the histogram of the similarity rank of the true speaker, or when\ndata is scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We\nexpress the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure\nfrom independent features are additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all\ntested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying\ninformation (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker\nrecognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone\nembeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial\nexperiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test\nsamples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided\nmetric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of\nPII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification. It can\nthus aid in the holistic evaluation of threats to privacy in speech and other\nbiometric technologies.",

To address this gap, our paper\nintroduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving\nthis objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods\nsuch as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field\nlacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several\nsolutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a\ntraining-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the\norigin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the\nlack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy\nscenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move\nbeyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization.

With the growing\nrisk of cyberattacks, regulatory compliance requirements are also increasing\nfor large scale critical infrastructure systems comprising multiple utility\nstakeholders. The primary goal of regulators is to ensure overall system\nstability with recourse to trustworthy stakeholder attack detection. However,\nadhering to compliance requirements requires stakeholders to also disclose\nsensor and control data to regulators raising privacy concerns. In this paper,\nwe present a cyberattack detection framework that utilizes differentially\nprivate (DP) hypothesis tests geared towards enhancing regulatory confidence\nwhile alleviating privacy concerns of CIN stakeholders. The hallmark of our\napproach is a two phase privacy scheme that protects the privacy of covariance,\nas well as the associated sensor driven test statistics computed as a means to\ngenerate alarms. Theoretically, we show that our method induces a\nmisclassification error rate comparable to the non-DP cases while delivering\nrobust privacy guarantees.

    "summary" : "Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of\nlarge-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of\nfacial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

    "summary" : "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and\nfacilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.\nHowever, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's\nprivacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on\nthe privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop\ninteractions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium.

    "summary" : "Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to\ncollaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the\nexchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a\ncentral server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of\nexposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy\nconcerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become\na widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its\nadvantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses\nchallenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in\nnon-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization\nproblems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential\nPrivate Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving\nalgorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max\noptimization.

    "summary" : "As Extended Reality (XR) devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday\nsettings, they raise significant privacy concerns for bystanders: individuals\nin the vicinity of an XR device during its use, whom the device sensors may\naccidentally capture. Current privacy indicators, such as small LEDs, often\npresume that bystanders are attentive enough to interpret the privacy signals.\nHowever, these cues can be easily overlooked when bystanders are distracted or\nhave limited vision. We define such individuals as situationally impaired\nbystanders. This study explores XR privacy indicator designs that are effective\nfor situationally impaired bystanders. A focus group with eight participants\nwas conducted to design five novel privacy indicators. We evaluated these\ndesigns through a user study with seven additional participants. Our results\nshow that visual-only indicators, typical in commercial XR devices, received\nlow ratings for perceived usefulness in impairment scenarios. In contrast,\nmultimodal indicators were preferred in privacy-sensitive scenarios with\nsituationally impaired bystanders. Ultimately, our results highlight the need\nto move toward adaptable, multimodal, and situationally aware designs that\neffectively support bystander privacy in everyday XR environments.",

    "title" : "Balancing Privacy and Efficiency: Music Information Retrieval via\n  Additive Homomorphic Encryption",
    "summary" : "In the era of generative AI, ensuring the privacy of music data presents\nunique challenges: unlike static artworks such as images, music data is\ninherently temporal and multimodal, and it is sampled, transformed, and remixed\nat an unprecedented scale. These characteristics make its core vector\nembeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible\nto being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the\noriginal audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital\nwatermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical\nrepresentations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach\nto safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as\nAES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches\nimpossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible\nsolution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial\nperformance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity\nsearches. Given this trade-off, we propose a more practical approach using\nAdditive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) for vector similarity search. The primary\ncontributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to\nmusic information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and\npropose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music\nembeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we\ndemonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through\nempirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.",

    "summary" : "LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT have created large volumes of conversational\ndata, but little is known about how user privacy expectations are evolving with\nthis technology. We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to\nunderstand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal\na stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated\nchatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or\nsocial media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over\none-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed\nstrong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations\nwould remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents\nuniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device\naccess) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth\n$200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we\npresented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual\nfactors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such\nas informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally\nidentifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness\nand concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the\nrecipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs.\nadvertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant\neffects. Our results suggest that users apply consistent baseline privacy\nexpectations to chatbot data, prioritizing procedural safeguards over recipient\ntrustworthiness. This has important implications for emerging agentic AI\nsystems that assume user willingness to integrate personal data across\nplatforms.",

    "summary" : "Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often\ncompare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the\nidentity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be\ninaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as\nthe most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate\nsimilarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We\npropose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a\nsimilarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on\ndetermining the histogram of the similarity rank of the true speaker, or when\ndata is scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We\nexpress the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure\nfrom independent features are additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all\ntested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying\ninformation (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker\nrecognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone\nembeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial\nexperiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test\nsamples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided\nmetric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of\nPII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification.

    "summary" : "LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.\nRAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like\nthat in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses\nsignificant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential\ninsecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking\ntransparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.",

    "title" : "Security Analysis of ChatGPT: Threats and Privacy Risks",
    "summary" : "As artificial intelligence technology continues to advance, chatbots are\nbecoming increasingly powerful. Among them, ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI, has\ngarnered widespread attention globally due to its powerful natural language\nprocessing capabilities based on the GPT model, which enables it to engage in\nnatural conversations with users, understand various forms of linguistic\nexpressions, and generate useful information and suggestions. However, as its\napplication scope expands, user demand grows, and malicious attacks related to\nit become increasingly frequent, the security threats and privacy risks faced\nby ChatGPT are gradually coming to the forefront. In this paper, the security\nof ChatGPT is mainly studied from two aspects, security threats and privacy\nrisks. The article systematically analyzes various types of vulnerabilities\ninvolved in the above two types of problems and their causes. Briefly, we\ndiscuss the controversies that ChatGPT may cause at the ethical and moral\nlevels. In addition, this paper reproduces several network attack and defense\ntest scenarios by simulating the attacker's perspective and methodology.\nSimultaneously, it explores the feasibility of using ChatGPT for security\nvulnerability detection and security tool generation from the defender's\nperspective.",

    "summary" : "As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become\nmore prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind\nand low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information\nin their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained\nsegmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost\nof usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy\nprotection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information\nwhile preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained\nsegmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our\nframework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%\nof image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by\n11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.\nProject Page: https://artcs1.github.io/VLMPrivacy/",

    "summary" : "The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems\n(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the\nfundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as\nblurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable\ntrade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction\nattacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we\npropose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into\nprivacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image\ntransmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nfor nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic\naccuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of\nreplay attacks to just 9.4\\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously\ngenerating richer textual content than baseline methods.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.",

    "summary" : "In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which\ncenters on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition\nmodel. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any\nexisting public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage.

However, existing PP-ANNS solutions fall short of meeting\nthe requirements of data privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and minimal user\ninvolvement concurrently. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel\nsolution that primarily executes PP-ANNS on a single cloud server to avoid the\nheavy communication overhead between the cloud and the user.

Then, we devise a search\nmethod using a filter-and-refine strategy based on the index. Moreover, we\nprovide the security analysis of our solution and conduct extensive experiments\nto demonstrate its superiority over existing solutions.
