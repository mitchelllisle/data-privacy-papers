    "title" : "Evaluating the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Generating\n  Fine-Grained Visual Privacy Policies in Homes",
    "summary" : "The proliferation of visual sensors in smart home environments, particularly\nthrough wearable devices like smart glasses, introduces profound privacy\nchallenges. Existing privacy controls are often static and coarse-grained,\nfailing to accommodate the dynamic and socially nuanced nature of home\nenvironments. This paper investigates the viability of using Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as the core of a dynamic and adaptive privacy policy engine. We\npropose a conceptual framework where visual data is classified using a\nmulti-dimensional schema that considers data sensitivity, spatial context, and\nsocial presence. An LLM then reasons over this contextual information to\nenforce fine-grained privacy rules, such as selective object obfuscation, in\nreal-time. Through a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art Vision Language\nModels (including GPT-4o and the Qwen-VL series) in simulated home settings ,\nour findings show the feasibility of this approach. The LLM-based engine\nachieved a top machine-evaluated appropriateness score of 3.99 out of 5, and\nthe policies generated by the models received a top human-evaluated score of\n4.00 out of 5.",

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Driver Drowsiness Detection with Spatial\n  Self-Attention and Federated Learning",
    "summary" : "Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is\nrecognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,\ndetecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in\nreal-world settings where facial data from different individuals is\ndecentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nfor drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with\nheterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial\nSelf-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetwork to better extract key facial features and improve detection\nperformance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity\nComparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different\noperators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the\nglobal model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool\nthat automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and\ncropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,\nflipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that\nour framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning\nsettings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling\nreal-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in\nintelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and\nreliable drowsiness detection.",

    "summary" : "Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pok\\'emon Go,\nstream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user\nexperiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious\nprivacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging\nthan in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time\nlocation protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy\nguaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS).\nExisting methods fail to meet these combined demands.\n  To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework\nfor real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar\nStaircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to\ngenerate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected\nerror; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme\nthat releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a\nprivate threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level\nprivacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and\nvalidate PrivAR on a Pok\\'emon-Go-style prototype.

This study presents the\nfirst real-world experimental evaluation of three post-quantum secure HE\nschemes, i.e., Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan\n(BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), for vehicular communication scenarios.\nTwo representative privacy-preserving use cases are considered: encrypted\nvehicle counting and average speed aggregation. Experiments are conducted over\nboth Wi-Fi and Ethernet to assess performance under wireless and wired\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) settings. Results show that BFV and BGV are\nsuitable for latency-tolerant applications such as intersection monitoring and\nregional traffic analysis, with total end-to-end latencies under 10 seconds.\nWhile CKKS experiences higher overhead, it remains viable for periodic\nencrypted aggregation of numerical data. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat HE can be feasibly deployed in ITS environments under 128-bit post-quantum\nsecurity, provided that scheme-specific latency constraints are considered.\nThis reinforces its potential to serve as a foundational tool for secure and\nprivacy-preserving V2X data processing.",

    "summary" : "Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale\nimage retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like\nClearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a\nlarge amount of online content associated with that person. This not only\nenables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as\nsocial media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their\nconsent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a\nuser-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such\nretrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial\nsignatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically\ndeformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of\nany facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by\na critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of\nFR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.\nExperiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a\nwide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing\nmethods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video\nsettings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,\nProtego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance\nand unsolicited identity tracing.",

    "summary" : "Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance\nquality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless\ncommunication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to\nthat of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching\nmethods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper\nsystem performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based\noptimization approaches.",

To\nmitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,\nDataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage\nefficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with\nDP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without\ncompromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods\nsuffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on\nnoisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the\ninefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive\nnoise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples\nsampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality\nby mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative\nsubspace.

    "summary" : "With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in\nprivacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,\nensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party\ncomputation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from\nhigh communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the\nexpensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a\npromising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision\ninteger computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing\nMPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization\nparameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in\nhandling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we\npropose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight\nfully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup\ntable protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we\nuse dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup\ntables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on\nBERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\\times$\nspeedup compared to Lu \\emph{et al}.

    "title" : "Lifelong Person Re-identification via Privacy-Preserving Data Replay",
    "summary" : "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate\nknowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy\neffectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused\nby domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the\nproposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving\ndata privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on\nsequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other\nreplay-based methods, respectively.",

    "title" : "Open Data Sharing in Clinical Research and Participants Privacy:\n  Challenges and Opportunities in the Era of Artificial Intelligence",
    "summary" : "Sharing clinical research data is key for increasing the pace of medical\ndiscoveries that improve human health. However, concern about study\nparticipants' privacy, confidentiality, and safety is a major factor that\ndeters researchers from openly sharing clinical data, even after\ndeidentification. This concern is further heightened by the evolution of\nartificial intelligence (AI) approaches that pose an ever-increasing threat to\nthe reidentification of study participants. Here, we discuss the challenges AI\napproaches create that blur the lines between identifiable and non-identifiable\ndata. We present a concept of pseudo-reidentification, and discuss how these\nchallenges provide opportunities for rethinking open data sharing practices in\nclinical research. We highlight the novel open data sharing approach we have\nestablished as part of the Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas\nfor Diabetes Insights project, one of the four Data Generation Projects funded\nby the National Institutes of Health Common Fund's Bridge2AI Program.",

    "summary" : "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable\nability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a\nsubstantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a\npotential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often\nperform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may\nintroduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose\nGeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy\nprotection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a\nfeature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical\ninformation, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints\ngeo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module\nthat jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure\neffectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging\nbenchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in\nblack-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on\nvisual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore\nadversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by\nadvanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating\nprivacy concerns.",

    "summary" : "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.\nHowever, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are\nsusceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information\nthrough generated responses.

PAD integrates confidence-based\nscreening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity\nestimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration\nto balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)\naccountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit\nper-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.\nUnlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is\nmodel-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

To demonstrate this methodology, we\nfocus on PETs supporting client-server applications as they are the simplest to\ndeploy. In particular, we measure the energy consumption and carbon footprint\nincrease induced by five cryptographic PETs (compared to their non-private\nequivalent): HTTPS web browsing, encrypted machine learning (ML) inference,\nencrypted ML training, encrypted databases, and encrypted emails. Our findings\nreveal significant variability in carbon footprint increases, ranging from a\ntwofold increase in HTTPS web browsing to a 100,000-fold increase in encrypted\nML.\n  Our study provides essential data to help decision-makers assess\nprivacy-carbon trade-offs in such applications.

    "summary" : "User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy\npreferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over\ntime. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously\ncollect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user\nbehaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,\nfew-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify\nand modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive\n(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).\nLeveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU\nsensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding\nspace, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a\nprivacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided\nactivity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the\noriginal data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a\nnon-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity\nrecognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.",

As bandit algorithms\nare increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes\ncritical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision\nrounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in\nbandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved\nsimultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit\nalgorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas\nfairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes\ninequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound\n(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,\nmatching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is\nsufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential\nprivacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time\nhorizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic\nbandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret\nthan state-of-the-art baselines.

Distance, a critical factor in graph analysis, is typically handled\nusing curator DP, where a trusted curator holds the complete neighbor lists of\nall vertices and answers queries privately. However, in many real-world\nscenarios, such a curator may not be present, posing a significant challenge\nfor implementing differentially private distance queries under Local\nDifferential Privacy (LDP). This paper proposes two approaches to address this\nchallenge. The first approach generates a synthetic graph by randomizing\nresponses and applies bitwise operations to reduce noise interference. However,\nlike other synthetic graph methods, this approach suffers from low utility. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a second approach, the first LDP method\nspecifically designed for distance queries, which captures the global graph\nstructure by continuously aggregating local distance vectors from neighboring\nvertices. This process enables the accurate updating of global distances.

    "title" : "Privacy Disclosure of Similarity in Speech and Language Processing",
    "summary" : "Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often\ncompare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the\nidentity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be\ninaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as\nthe most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate\nsimilarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We\npropose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a\nsimilarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on\ndetermining the histogram of the similarity rank of the true speaker, or when\ndata is scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We\nexpress the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure\nfrom independent features are additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all\ntested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying\ninformation (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker\nrecognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone\nembeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial\nexperiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test\nsamples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided\nmetric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of\nPII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification. It can\nthus aid in the holistic evaluation of threats to privacy in speech and other\nbiometric technologies.",

To address this gap, our paper\nintroduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving\nthis objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods\nsuch as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field\nlacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several\nsolutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a\ntraining-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the\norigin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the\nlack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy\nscenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move\nbeyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization.

With the growing\nrisk of cyberattacks, regulatory compliance requirements are also increasing\nfor large scale critical infrastructure systems comprising multiple utility\nstakeholders. The primary goal of regulators is to ensure overall system\nstability with recourse to trustworthy stakeholder attack detection. However,\nadhering to compliance requirements requires stakeholders to also disclose\nsensor and control data to regulators raising privacy concerns. In this paper,\nwe present a cyberattack detection framework that utilizes differentially\nprivate (DP) hypothesis tests geared towards enhancing regulatory confidence\nwhile alleviating privacy concerns of CIN stakeholders. The hallmark of our\napproach is a two phase privacy scheme that protects the privacy of covariance,\nas well as the associated sensor driven test statistics computed as a means to\ngenerate alarms. Theoretically, we show that our method induces a\nmisclassification error rate comparable to the non-DP cases while delivering\nrobust privacy guarantees.

    "summary" : "Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of\nlarge-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of\nfacial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

    "summary" : "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and\nfacilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.\nHowever, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's\nprivacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on\nthe privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop\ninteractions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium.

    "summary" : "Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to\ncollaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the\nexchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a\ncentral server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of\nexposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy\nconcerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become\na widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its\nadvantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses\nchallenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in\nnon-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization\nproblems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential\nPrivate Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving\nalgorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max\noptimization.

    "summary" : "As Extended Reality (XR) devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday\nsettings, they raise significant privacy concerns for bystanders: individuals\nin the vicinity of an XR device during its use, whom the device sensors may\naccidentally capture. Current privacy indicators, such as small LEDs, often\npresume that bystanders are attentive enough to interpret the privacy signals.\nHowever, these cues can be easily overlooked when bystanders are distracted or\nhave limited vision. We define such individuals as situationally impaired\nbystanders. This study explores XR privacy indicator designs that are effective\nfor situationally impaired bystanders. A focus group with eight participants\nwas conducted to design five novel privacy indicators. We evaluated these\ndesigns through a user study with seven additional participants. Our results\nshow that visual-only indicators, typical in commercial XR devices, received\nlow ratings for perceived usefulness in impairment scenarios. In contrast,\nmultimodal indicators were preferred in privacy-sensitive scenarios with\nsituationally impaired bystanders. Ultimately, our results highlight the need\nto move toward adaptable, multimodal, and situationally aware designs that\neffectively support bystander privacy in everyday XR environments.",

    "title" : "Balancing Privacy and Efficiency: Music Information Retrieval via\n  Additive Homomorphic Encryption",
    "summary" : "In the era of generative AI, ensuring the privacy of music data presents\nunique challenges: unlike static artworks such as images, music data is\ninherently temporal and multimodal, and it is sampled, transformed, and remixed\nat an unprecedented scale. These characteristics make its core vector\nembeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible\nto being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the\noriginal audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital\nwatermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical\nrepresentations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach\nto safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as\nAES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches\nimpossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible\nsolution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial\nperformance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity\nsearches. Given this trade-off, we propose a more practical approach using\nAdditive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) for vector similarity search. The primary\ncontributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to\nmusic information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and\npropose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music\nembeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we\ndemonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through\nempirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.",

    "summary" : "LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT have created large volumes of conversational\ndata, but little is known about how user privacy expectations are evolving with\nthis technology. We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to\nunderstand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal\na stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated\nchatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or\nsocial media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over\none-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed\nstrong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations\nwould remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents\nuniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device\naccess) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth\n$200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we\npresented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual\nfactors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such\nas informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally\nidentifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness\nand concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the\nrecipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs.\nadvertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant\neffects. Our results suggest that users apply consistent baseline privacy\nexpectations to chatbot data, prioritizing procedural safeguards over recipient\ntrustworthiness. This has important implications for emerging agentic AI\nsystems that assume user willingness to integrate personal data across\nplatforms.",

    "summary" : "Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often\ncompare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the\nidentity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be\ninaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as\nthe most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate\nsimilarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We\npropose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a\nsimilarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on\ndetermining the histogram of the similarity rank of the true speaker, or when\ndata is scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We\nexpress the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure\nfrom independent features are additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all\ntested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying\ninformation (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker\nrecognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone\nembeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial\nexperiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test\nsamples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided\nmetric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of\nPII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification.

    "summary" : "LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.\nRAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like\nthat in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses\nsignificant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential\ninsecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking\ntransparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.",

    "title" : "Security Analysis of ChatGPT: Threats and Privacy Risks",
    "summary" : "As artificial intelligence technology continues to advance, chatbots are\nbecoming increasingly powerful. Among them, ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI, has\ngarnered widespread attention globally due to its powerful natural language\nprocessing capabilities based on the GPT model, which enables it to engage in\nnatural conversations with users, understand various forms of linguistic\nexpressions, and generate useful information and suggestions. However, as its\napplication scope expands, user demand grows, and malicious attacks related to\nit become increasingly frequent, the security threats and privacy risks faced\nby ChatGPT are gradually coming to the forefront. In this paper, the security\nof ChatGPT is mainly studied from two aspects, security threats and privacy\nrisks. The article systematically analyzes various types of vulnerabilities\ninvolved in the above two types of problems and their causes. Briefly, we\ndiscuss the controversies that ChatGPT may cause at the ethical and moral\nlevels. In addition, this paper reproduces several network attack and defense\ntest scenarios by simulating the attacker's perspective and methodology.\nSimultaneously, it explores the feasibility of using ChatGPT for security\nvulnerability detection and security tool generation from the defender's\nperspective.",

    "summary" : "As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become\nmore prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind\nand low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information\nin their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained\nsegmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost\nof usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy\nprotection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information\nwhile preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained\nsegmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our\nframework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%\nof image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by\n11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.\nProject Page: https://artcs1.github.io/VLMPrivacy/",

    "summary" : "The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems\n(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the\nfundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as\nblurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable\ntrade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction\nattacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we\npropose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into\nprivacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image\ntransmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nfor nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic\naccuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of\nreplay attacks to just 9.4\\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously\ngenerating richer textual content than baseline methods.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.",

    "summary" : "In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which\ncenters on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition\nmodel. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any\nexisting public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage.

However, existing PP-ANNS solutions fall short of meeting\nthe requirements of data privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and minimal user\ninvolvement concurrently. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel\nsolution that primarily executes PP-ANNS on a single cloud server to avoid the\nheavy communication overhead between the cloud and the user.

Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations\ndirectly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire\nmachine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear\noperations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions,\nessential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing,\nimplementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based\nmachine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square\nfunction and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20\narchitectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we\nassess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a\nnovel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE\nconstraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in\nshallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per\nimage. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The\npolynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image,\nwhile our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a\nlonger inference time of 1,697 seconds. These results underscore a critical\ntrade-off in FHE-based ML: faster activation functions often reduce accuracy,\nwhereas those preserving accuracy demand greater computational resources.",

    "summary" : "To protect privacy for data-collection-based services, local differential\nprivacy (LDP) is widely adopted due to its rigorous theoretical bound on\nprivacy loss. However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle\nimplementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this,\nauditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data.\nHowever, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and\nfederated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with\nlimited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus\nsolely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving\ncorrelated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation\nfor keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based\nkey-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower\nbounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary\noutput predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing\nunbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we\nclassify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and\nnon-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal\nKV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor\nfor large domains with limited samples. For interactive mechanisms, we design a\nsegmentation strategy to capture incremental privacy leakage across iterations.\nFinally, we perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our\napproach, offering insights for optimizing LDP-based key-value estimators.",

    "summary" : "Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of\nextracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,\nespecially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant\ncomputational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep\nneural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,\nfingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric\nsensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by\ncombining features from different modalities. This work investigates the\nbiometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments\nare conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from\nDNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,\nand CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and\nstraightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)\ncapable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to\nfewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more\nefficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and\nsecurity at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.\nOur results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple\nmodalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error\nRate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.",

    "summary" : "The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems\n(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the\nright to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving methods, such as blurring or\nencryption, are often insufficient due to creating an undesirable trade-off\nwhere either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or\ndata utility is critically degraded. To resolve this challenge, we propose\nRL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into\nprivacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image\ntransmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nfor nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic\naccuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of\nreplay attacks to just 9.4\\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously\ngenerating richer textual content than baseline methods.

    "summary" : "Introduction: The rise in public medical imaging datasets has raised concerns\nabout patient reidentification from head CT scans. However, existing defacing\nalgorithms often remove or distort Organs at Risk (OARs) and Planning Target\nVolumes (PTVs) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, and ignore DICOM-RT\nStructure Set and Dose data. Therefore, we developed and validated a novel\nautomated defacing algorithm that preserves these critical structures while\nremoving identifiable features from HNC CTs and DICOM-RT data.\n  Methods: Eye contours were used as landmarks to automate the removal of CT\npixels above the inferior-most eye slice and anterior to the eye midpoint.\nPixels within PTVs were retained if they intersected with the removed region.\nThe body contour and dose map were reshaped to reflect the defaced image. We\nvalidated our approach on 829 HNC CTs from 622 patients. Privacy protection was\nevaluated by applying the FaceNet512 facial recognition algorithm before and\nafter defacing on 3D-rendered CT pairs from 70 patients. Research utility was\nassessed by examining the impact of defacing on autocontouring performance\nusing LimbusAI and analyzing PTV locations relative to the defaced regions.\n  Results: Before defacing, FaceNet512 matched 97% of patients' CTs. After\ndefacing, this rate dropped to 4%. LimbusAI effectively autocontoured organs in\nthe defaced CTs, with perfect Dice scores of 1 for OARs below the defaced\nregion, and excellent scores exceeding 0.95 for OARs on the same slices as the\ncrop. We found that 86% of PTVs were entirely below the cropped region, 9.1%\nwere on the same slice as the crop without overlap, and only 4.9% extended into\nthe cropped area.\n  Conclusions: We developed a novel defacing algorithm that anonymizes HNC CT\nscans and related DICOM-RT data while preserving essential structures, enabling\nthe sharing of HNC imaging datasets for Big Data and AI.",

    "summary" : "Local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nprivacy-preserving data collection in distributed systems, where users\ncontribute multi-dimensional records with potentially correlated attributes.\nRecent work has highlighted that correlation-induced privacy leakage (CPL)\nplays a critical role in shaping the privacy-utility trade-off under LDP,\nespecially when correlations exist among attributes. Nevertheless, it remains\nunclear to what extent the prevailing assumptions and proposed solutions are\nvalid and how significant CPL is in real-world data. To address this gap, we\nfirst perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of five widely used LDP\nmechanisms -- GRR, RAPPOR, OUE, OLH and Exponential mechanism -- to assess CPL\nacross four real-world datasets. We identify that many primary assumptions and\nmetrics in current approaches fall short of accurately characterising these\nleakages. Moreover, current studies have been limited to a set of pure LDP\n(i.e., {\\delta = 0}) mechanisms. In response, we develop the first algorithmic\nframework to theoretically quantify CPL for any general approximated LDP\n(({\\varepsilon},{\\delta})-LDP) mechanism. We validate our theoretical results\nagainst empirical statistical results and provide a theoretical explanation for\nthe observed statistical patterns. Finally, we propose two novel benchmarks to\nvalidate correlation analysis algorithms and evaluate the utility vs CPL of LDP\nmechanisms.

    "summary" : "Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of\nprivacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a\npromising approach $\\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in\nother subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$\nparadigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language\nevaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.\nRecognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we\ninvestigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the\nprivacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM\nevaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a\nstudy involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we\nconfirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,\nexhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find\nthat LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through\nan analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and\nlimitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our\nfindings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy\nevaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with\ninnovative technical solutions.",

    "summary" : "With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, the need for outsourcing\nstatistical analysis to third-party platforms is growing rapidly. However,\nhandling sensitive data such as medical records and financial information in\ncloud environments raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we present\nPP-STAT, a novel and efficient Homomorphic Encryption (HE)-based framework for\nprivacy-preserving statistical analysis. HE enables computations to be\nperformed directly on encrypted data without revealing the underlying\nplaintext. PP-STAT supports advanced statistical measures, including Z-score\nnormalization, skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation, and Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient, all computed securely over encrypted data. To improve\nefficiency, PP-STAT introduces two key optimizations: (1) a Chebyshev-based\napproximation strategy for initializing inverse square root operations, and (2)\na pre-normalization scaling technique that reduces multiplicative depth by\nfolding constant scaling factors into mean and variance computations. These\ntechniques significantly lower computational overhead and minimize the number\nof expensive bootstrapping procedures. Our evaluation on real-world datasets\ndemonstrates that PP-STAT achieves high numerical accuracy, with mean relative\nerror (MRE) below 2.4x10-4. Notably, the encrypted Pearson correlation between\nthe smoker attribute and charges reaches 0.7873, with an MRE of 2.86x10-4.\nThese results confirm the practical utility of PP-STAT for secure and precise\nstatistical analysis in privacy-sensitive domains.",

    "summary" : "Federated learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for collaborative model\ntraining while preserving data privacy. However, its susceptibility to gradient\ninversion attacks poses a significant challenge, necessitating robust privacy\nprotection mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework to\ndecipher the intricate interplay between attack and protection complexities in\nprivacy-preserving FL. We formally define \"Attack Complexity\" as the minimum\ncomputational and data resources an adversary requires to reconstruct private\ndata below a given error threshold, and \"Protection Complexity\" as the expected\ndistortion introduced by privacy mechanisms.

    "summary" : "Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming\nincreasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of\nsubmitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service\nplatform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the\nrequested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an\nindividual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable.\nHowever, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can\nsurpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and\nsynthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an\never-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable\nfrom authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are\nfaced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train\nfake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is\noriginated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept\nprivate by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government,\npolice, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and\ndiscuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection\nresearch. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over\n900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using\ndifferent smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In\naddition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite.\n3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We\nrelease a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic\nattacks from popular databases in the literature.",

To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage.

To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity\nComparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different\noperators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the\nglobal model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool\nthat automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and\ncropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,\nflipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that\nour framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning\nsettings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling\nreal-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in\nintelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and\nreliable drowsiness detection.",

    "title" : "MoEcho: Exploiting Side-Channel Attacks to Compromise User Privacy in\n  Mixture-of-Experts LLMs",
    "summary" : "The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling\nremarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,\ncomputer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale\nexplosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical\nchallenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating\nspecialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model\naccuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE\narchitectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized\nexperts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack\nsurface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave\ndistinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which\nadversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we\npropose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that\ncompromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we\nintroduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing\nplatforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and\nPerformance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user\nprivacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based\non MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,\nVisual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first\nruntime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure\ncommon in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy\nthreat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE\nbased models for developing efficient large scale AI services.",

To address this, we design a Bayesian\nincentive-compatible mechanism that facilitates rapid agreement on a fair\nransom without requiring either party to disclose private valuations. We\nfurther implement this mechanism using secure two-party computation based on\ngarbled circuits, thereby eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and\npreserving the privacy of both parties throughout the negotiation.

    "summary" : "With the rapid increase in online interactions, concerns over data privacy\nand transparency of data processing practices have become more pronounced.\nWhile regulations like the GDPR have driven the widespread adoption of cookie\nbanners in the EU, India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA)\npromises similar changes domestically, aiming to introduce a framework for data\nprotection. However, certain clauses within the DPDPA raise concerns about\npotential infringements on user privacy, given the exemptions for government\naccountability and user consent requirements. In this study, for the first\ntime, we explore Indian Internet users' awareness and perceptions of cookie\nbanners, online privacy, and privacy regulations, especially in light of the\nnewly passed DPDPA. We conducted an online anonymous survey with 428 Indian\nparticipants, which addressed: (1) users' perspectives on cookie banners, (2)\ntheir attitudes towards online privacy and privacy regulations, and (3) their\nacceptance of 10 contentious DPDPA clauses that favor state authorities and may\nenable surveillance. Our findings reveal that privacy-conscious users often\nlack consistent awareness of privacy mechanisms, and their concerns do not\nalways lead to protective actions. Our thematic analysis of 143 open ended\nresponses shows that users' privacy and data protection concerns are rooted in\nskepticism towards the government, shaping their perceptions of the DPDPA and\nfueling demands for policy revisions. Our study highlights the need for clearer\ncommunication regarding the DPDPA, user-centric consent mechanisms, and policy\nrefinements to enhance data privacy practices in India.",

    "summary" : "The increasing deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for military,\ncommercial, and logistics applications has raised significant concerns\nregarding flight path privacy. Conventional UAV communication systems often\nexpose flight path data to third parties, making them vulnerable to tracking,\nsurveillance, and location inference attacks.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a zk-SNARK(Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of\nKnowledge)-based privacy-preserving flight path authentication and verification\nframework. Our approach ensures that a UAV can prove its authorisation,\nvalidate its flight path with a control centre, and comply with regulatory\nconstraints without revealing any sensitive trajectory information. By\nleveraging zk-SNARKs, the UAV can generate cryptographic proofs that verify\ncompliance with predefined flight policies while keeping the exact path and\nlocation undisclosed. This method mitigates risks associated with real-time\ntracking, identity exposure, and unauthorised interception, thereby enhancing\nUAV operational security in adversarial environments.

    "summary" : "With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, the need for outsourcing\nstatistical analysis to third-party platforms is growing rapidly. However,\nhandling sensitive data such as medical records and financial information in\ncloud environments raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we present\nPP-STAT, a novel and efficient Homomorphic Encryption (HE)-based framework for\nprivacy-preserving statistical analysis. HE enables computations to be\nperformed directly on encrypted data without revealing the underlying\nplaintext. PP-STAT supports advanced statistical measures, including Z-score\nnormalization, skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation, and Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient, all computed securely over encrypted data. To improve\nefficiency, PP-STAT introduces two key optimizations: (1) a Chebyshev-based\napproximation strategy for initializing inverse square root operations, and (2)\na pre-normalization scaling technique that reduces multiplicative depth by\nfolding constant scaling factors into mean and variance computations. These\ntechniques significantly lower computational overhead and minimize the number\nof expensive bootstrapping procedures. Our evaluation on real-world datasets\ndemonstrates that PP-STAT achieves high numerical accuracy, with mean relative\nerror (MRE) below 2.4x10-4. Notably, the encrypted Pearson correlation between\nthe smoker attribute and charges reaches 0.7873, with an MRE of 2.86x10-4.\nThese results confirm the practical utility of PP-STAT for secure and precise\nstatistical analysis in privacy-sensitive domains.",

    "summary" : "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate\nknowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential\ndata into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving\nReplay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics\nof multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo\npixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data\nbut also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks.\nDuring the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one\nwhile simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the\ncurrent domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both\nclass-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly\nimproves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy.

Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data\nreconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy\nprotection by thinking adversarially.",

    "title" : "Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?",
    "summary" : "Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known\nscene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the\nscene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of\nimages or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,\nNeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality\nnovel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising\nprivacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as\nsensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this\nchallenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess\nprivacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained\nwith photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry\nrepresentations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head\nthat predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving\nNeural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation\nsupervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a\nself-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable\nscene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space\nof ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding\nstate-of-the-art results.",

    "summary" : "With the rapid growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) technology, EVs are destined\nto shape the future of transportation. The large number of EVs facilitates the\ndevelopment of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes\nbidirectional energy exchanges between EVs and the power grid. This has led to\nthe setting up of electricity markets that are usually confined to a small\ngeographical location, often with a small number of participants. Usually,\nthese markets are manipulated by intermediaries responsible for collecting bids\nfrom prosumers, determining the market-clearing price, incorporating grid\nconstraints, and accounting for network losses. While centralized models can be\nhighly efficient, they grant excessive power to the intermediary by allowing\nthem to gain exclusive access to prosumers \\textquotesingle price preferences.\nThis opens the door to potential market manipulation and raises significant\nprivacy concerns for users, such as the location of energy providers.

This study\ninvestigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare\ndata sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data\nusers. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we\npredict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the\nhospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently\nhospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to\nprivacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare\nutilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning\n(ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity,\nthe technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to\nreduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that\n$k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and\nMO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best\nutility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the\noriginal dataset.

    "summary" : "Balancing robust security with strong privacy guarantees is critical for\nRisk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA), particularly in decentralized\nsettings. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling\ncollaborative risk assessment without centralizing user data. However, existing\nFL approaches struggle with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed\n(Non-IID) user features, resulting in biased, unstable, and poorly generalized\nglobal models. This paper introduces FL-RBA2, a novel Federated Learning\nframework for Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication that addresses Non-IID\nchallenges through a mathematically grounded similarity transformation. By\nconverting heterogeneous user features (including behavioral, biometric,\ncontextual, interaction-based, and knowledge-based modalities) into IID\nsimilarity vectors, FL-RBA2 supports unbiased aggregation and personalized risk\nmodeling across distributed clients. The framework mitigates cold-start\nlimitations via clustering-based risk labeling, incorporates Differential\nPrivacy (DP) to safeguard sensitive information, and employs Message\nAuthentication Codes (MACs) to ensure model integrity and authenticity.\nFederated updates are securely aggregated into a global model, achieving strong\nbalance between user privacy, scalability, and adaptive authentication\nrobustness. Rigorous game-based security proofs in the Random Oracle Model\nformally establish privacy, correctness, and adaptive security guarantees.\nExtensive experiments on keystroke, mouse, and contextual datasets validate\nFL-RBA2's effectiveness in high-risk user detection and its resilience to model\ninversion and inference attacks, even under strong DP constraints.",

    "summary" : "Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and\nunstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables\nprivacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains\nvulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.\nThese challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating\nzero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address\nthese challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated\nlearning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential\nprivacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and\nintegrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and\nsecure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation\nmechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to\nenhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and\nquantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind\npower data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind\nfarm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated\nlearning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in\nthe energy sector.",

    "summary" : "A membership-inference attack gets the output of a learning algorithm, and a\ntarget individual, and tries to determine whether this individual is a member\nof the training data or an independent sample from the same distribution. A\nsuccessful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have\nsome knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,\nand this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference\nsamples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting,\n$\\Omega(n + n^2 \\rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that\ncompetes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that\nthe attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses\nto train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as\nall attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples\nand cannot benefit from $\\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be\nunderestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may\nbe possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.",

    "summary" : "The performance of modern machine learning systems depends on access to\nlarge, high-quality datasets, often sourced from user-generated content or\nproprietary, domain-specific corpora. However, these rich datasets inherently\ncontain sensitive personal information, raising significant concerns about\nprivacy, data security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. While\nconventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such\nremoval may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks.\nMore importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference\nattacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or\ndemographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards\nduring model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user\nprivacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that\nfine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that\njointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and\noutput diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the\nprivacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a\nminimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. By modeling these\nprivacy-sensitive signals in their distributional context, the proposed\napproach guides the model to generate synthetic rewrites that preserve utility\nwhile mitigating privacy risks. Empirical results show that the proposed method\nsignificantly enhances author obfuscation and privacy metrics without degrading\nsemantic quality, providing a scalable and model-agnostic solution for privacy\npreserving data generation in the era of large language models.",
