[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00841v1","title":"A Taxonomy of Privacy Constructs for Privacy-Sensitive Robotics","summary":"The introduction of robots into our society will also introduce new concerns about personal privacy. In order to study these concerns, we must do human-subject experiments that involve measuring privacy-relevant constructs. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy constructs based on a review of the privacy literature. Future work in operationalizing privacy constructs for HRI studies is also discussed.","updated":"2017-01-05T01:01:13Z","published":"2017-01-03T21:42:58Z","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Rueben"},{"name":"Cindy M.
