[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04819v5","title":"Integral Privacy for Sampling","summary":"Differential privacy is a leading protection setting, focused by design on individual privacy. Many applications, in medical / pharmaceutical domains or social networks, rather posit privacy at a group level, a setting we call integral privacy. We aim for the strongest form of privacy: the group size is in particular not known in advance. We study a problem with related applications in domains cited above that have recently met with substantial recent press: sampling.\n  Keeping correct utility levels in such a strong model of statistical indistinguishability looks difficult to be achieved with the usual differential privacy toolbox because it would typically scale in the worst case the sensitivity by the sample size and so the noise variance by up to its square. We introduce a trick specific to sampling that bypasses the sensitivity analysis. Privacy enforces an information theoretic barrier on approximation, and we show how to reach this barrier with guarantees on the approximation of the target non private density. We do so using a recent approach to non private density estimation relying on the original boosting theory, learning the sufficient statistics of an exponential family with classifiers. Approximation guarantees cover the mode capture problem. In the context of learning, the sampling problem is particularly important: because integral privacy enjoys the same closure under post-processing as differential privacy does, any algorithm using integrally privacy sampled data would result in an output equally integrally private. We also show that this brings fairness guarantees on post-processing that would eventually elude classical differential privacy: any decision process has bounded data-dependent bias when the data is integrally privately sampled. Experimental results against private kernel density estimation and private GANs displays the quality of our results.","updated":"2019-07-04T00:03:35Z","published":"2018-06-13T02:01:22Z","authors":[{"name":"Hisham Husain"},{"name":"Zac Cranko"},{"name":"Richard Nock"}],"categories":["stat.ML","cs.LG"]},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00966v1","title":"Segmentation, Incentives and Privacy","summary":"Data driven segmentation is the powerhouse behind the success of online advertising. Various underlying challenges for successful segmentation have been studied by the academic community, with one notable exception - consumers incentives have been typically ignored. This lacuna is troubling as consumers have much control over the data being collected. Missing or manipulated data could lead to inferior segmentation. The current work proposes a model of prior-free segmentation, inspired by models of facility location, and to the best of our knowledge provides the first segmentation mechanism that addresses incentive compatibility, efficient market segmentation and privacy in the absence of a common prior.","updated":"2018-06-05T00:14:28Z","published":"2018-06-04T06:01:47Z","authors":[{"name":"Kobbi Nissim"},{"name":"Rann Smorodinsky"},{"name":"Moshe Tennenholtz"}],"categories":["cs.GT"]}]
