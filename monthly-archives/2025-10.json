    "title" : "Sensitivity, Specificity, and Consistency: A Tripartite Evaluation of\n  Privacy Filters for Synthetic Data Generation",
    "summary" : "The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue\nfor overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering\ntechniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable\ninformation, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their\neffectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous\nevaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary\nto claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current\nfilters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity\nonly for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated\nfrom training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc\nfiltering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods\nmay provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of\npatient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter\ndesign are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive\napplications.",

    "summary" : "The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\ndisproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a\nconstellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain\nunderexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM\nsystems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from\ndata collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent\ncapabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference\nattacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM\nlifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through\ncase studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted\nthreats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers\npublished at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal\nthat while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the\nmost pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches\noffer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a\nfundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving\nbeyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing\ninterdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these\nemerging threats.",

    "summary" : "Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy\nrisk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary\napplications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,\nprovides a privacy-preserving substitute.

In order to handle\nnon-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the\ncentral server that weights local model updates according to their\nsignificance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data\nwhile preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using\nFVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese\nConvolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client\ncontributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global\nmodel.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework\nare superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according\nto experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of\nthe attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and\nCentralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively.

    "summary" : "Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively\non generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer\nlargely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a\nnovel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained\nclassifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the\nsource data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source\nfeature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian\nprior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift\nnoisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we\nsample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion\nmodule to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the\ntarget encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries\nwithout source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module\nenhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts\nperformance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.\nDVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for\nexplicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain\nadaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.",

    "summary" : "The proliferation of digital technologies has led to unprecedented data\ncollection, with facial data emerging as a particularly sensitive commodity.\nCompanies are increasingly leveraging advanced facial recognition technologies,\noften without the explicit consent or awareness of individuals, to build\nsophisticated surveillance capabilities. This practice, fueled by weak and\nfragmented laws in many jurisdictions, has created a regulatory vacuum that\nallows for the commercialization of personal identity and poses significant\nthreats to individual privacy and autonomy. This article introduces the concept\nof Facial Privacy. It analyzes the profound challenges posed by unregulated\nfacial recognition by conducting a comprehensive review of existing legal\nframeworks. It examines and compares regulations such as the GDPR, Brazil's\nLGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, and privacy acts in China, Singapore, South Korea, and\nJapan, alongside sector-specific laws in the United States like the Illinois\nBiometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The analysis highlights the societal\nimpacts of this technology, including the potential for discriminatory bias and\nthe long-lasting harm that can result from the theft of immutable biometric\ndata. Ultimately, the paper argues that existing legal loopholes and\nambiguities leave individuals vulnerable.

Our main contributions are threefold:\nFirstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition\nfor capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting\nchannel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and\nparameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing\nchannels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a\nsingle-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private\nchannels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an\napplication, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet\nunbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private\nchannels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its\nvalidity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds\nwith continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that\nchannels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from\nthe set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate\n(anti-)degradability bounds are not tight.

However, the methods proposed in that\nstudy rely on a white-box setting that adversaries can directly modify the\nsystem prompt. This condition is unlikely to hold in real-world deployments.\nThe limitation raises a critical question: can unprivileged attackers still\ninduce such privacy risks in practical LLM-integrated applications? To address\nthis question, we propose \\textsc{VortexPIA}, a novel indirect prompt injection\nattack that induces privacy extraction in LLM-integrated applications under\nblack-box settings. By injecting token-efficient data containing false\nmemories, \\textsc{VortexPIA} misleads LLMs to actively request private\ninformation in batches. Unlike prior methods, \\textsc{VortexPIA} allows\nattackers to flexibly define multiple categories of sensitive data.

    "summary" : "Diffusion Models have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable\ncapabilities in image generation, albeit at the cost of intensive computation\nrequirement. Meanwhile, despite their widespread deployment in inference\nservices such as Midjourney, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive\ninformation in uploaded user prompts have arisen. Existing solutions either\nlack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to strike an effective balance between\nutility and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ObCLIP, a plug-and-play\nsafeguard that enables oblivious cloud-device hybrid generation. By oblivious,\neach input prompt is transformed into a set of semantically similar candidate\nprompts that differ only in sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). The\ncloud server processes all candidate prompts without knowing which one is the\nreal one, thus preventing any prompt leakage. To mitigate server cost, only a\nsmall portion of denoising steps is performed upon the large cloud model. The\nintermediate latents are then sent back to the client, which selects the\ntargeted latent and completes the remaining denoising using a small device\nmodel. Additionally, we analyze and incorporate several cache-based\naccelerations that leverage temporal and batch redundancy, effectively reducing\ncomputation cost with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that ObCLIP provides rigorous privacy and\ncomparable utility to cloud models with slightly increased server cost.",

    "title" : "FHEON: A Configurable Framework for Developing Privacy-Preserving Neural\n  Networks Using Homomorphic Encryption",
    "summary" : "The widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service raises critical\nprivacy and security concerns, particularly about data confidentiality and\ntrust in both cloud providers and the machine learning models. Homomorphic\nEncryption (HE) has emerged as a promising solution to this problems, allowing\ncomputations on encrypted data without decryption. Despite its potential,\nexisting approaches to integrate HE into neural networks are often limited to\nspecific architectures, leaving a wide gap in providing a framework for easy\ndevelopment of HE-friendly privacy-preserving neural network models similar to\nwhat we have in the broader field of machine learning. In this paper, we\npresent FHEON, a configurable framework for developing privacy-preserving\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models for inference using HE. FHEON\nintroduces optimized and configurable implementations of privacy-preserving CNN\nlayers including convolutional layers, average pooling layers, ReLU activation\nfunctions, and fully connected layers. These layers are configured using\nparameters like input channels, output channels, kernel size, stride, and\npadding to support arbitrary CNN architectures. We assess the performance of\nFHEON using several CNN architectures, including LeNet-5, VGG-11, VGG- 16,\nResNet-20, and ResNet-34. FHEON maintains encrypted-domain accuracies within\n+/- 1% of their plaintext counterparts for ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 models.\nNotably, on a consumer-grade CPU, the models build on FHEON achieved 98.5%\naccuracy with a latency of 13 seconds on MNIST using LeNet-5, and 92.2%\naccuracy with a latency of 403 seconds on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20.\nAdditionally, FHEON operates within a practical memory budget requiring not\nmore than 42.3 GB for VGG-16.",

    "title" : "Privacy Enhancement in Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Adaptive\n  Receive Scaling",
    "summary" : "In Federated Learning (FL) with over-the-air aggregation, the quality of the\nsignal received at the server critically depends on the receive scaling\nfactors. While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and\nimprove training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by\nreducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive\nscaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between\ntraining convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel\nconditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the\noverall R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training\nprocess, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the\nglobal loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we\nobserve that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop\na new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round\nproblems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the\ndynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it\nachieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while\nensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical\nexperiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach\neffectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks without compromising learning performance.",

    "summary" : "Distributed control of connected and automated vehicles has attracted\nconsiderable interest for its potential to improve traffic efficiency and\nsafety. However, such control schemes require sharing privacy-sensitive vehicle\ndata, which introduces risks of information leakage and potential malicious\nactivities. This paper investigates the stability and privacy-preserving\nproperties of distributed platoon control under two types of quantizers:\ndeterministic and probabilistic. For deterministic quantization, we show that\nthe resulting control strategy ensures the system errors remain uniformly\nultimately bounded. Moreover, in the absence of auxiliary information, an\neavesdropper cannot uniquely infer sensitive vehicle states. In contrast, the\nuse of probabilistic quantization enables asymptotic convergence of the vehicle\nplatoon in expectation with bounded variance. Importantly, probabilistic\nquantizers can satisfy differential privacy guarantees, thereby preserving\nprivacy even when the eavesdropper possesses arbitrary auxiliary information.\nWe further analyze the trade-off between control performance and privacy by\nformulating an optimization problem that characterizes the impact of the\nquantization step on both metrics. Numerical simulations are provided to\nillustrate the performance differences between the two quantization strategies.",

Existing methods often\nstruggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse\napplication scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to\nalleviate these drawbacks.

To address these limitations, our initial work\nintroduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding\nwith policy-guided search.

However,\npractical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled\ndata shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation\nmodels that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While\nself-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are\nnot particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --\nlet alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and\nnoisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model\nbased on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of\nprivacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our\npre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input\nreconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even\nfrom less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation\nlies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level\nsimilarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.\nWith our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted\nmasked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both\ngranular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level\nassociative relationships across different snippets.

    "title" : "Spectral Graph Clustering under Differential Privacy: Balancing Privacy,\n  Accuracy, and Efficiency",
    "summary" : "We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential\nprivacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation\nvia randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which\nenforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph.\nImportantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping\nedges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP\nguarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves\n(epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of\nnodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a\nlower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity;\nand (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across\niterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis\nprovides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the\nmisclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks\nvalidate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility\ntrade-offs.",

    "summary" : "We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion\nframework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic\nelectronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.\nRareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human\nPhenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA\nAdverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph\ncomprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this\n8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward\nstochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically\nplausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining\nscore-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces\ntimestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag\ntriples that contain no protected health information. On simulated\nultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by\ngreater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream\npredictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the\nDOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55\nsafe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61\nplus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong\nresistance to re-identification.

We also analyze how the right is currently\nprotected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law. We\nshow that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects\nthree individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and\ntrust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and\norganizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially,\nthe right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a\nstrong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications,\nregardless of the technology used. Hence, the right does not merely serve\nindividual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are\ncrucial for the functioning of our information society.

Based on a comprehensive study using\ncircuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII\nleakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should\nbe responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware\nTargeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and\nsubsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves\nbetter privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall\nof PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to\nreduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis\nshows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing\ndefense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.",

The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection\nnot previously formalized in graph DP.

Along the way, we introduce\ngraph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier\nsubsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space\nincurred by prior work [ELMZ25].

    "summary" : "Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and\nheartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare\nsystems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional\nwireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the\nstringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,\nand privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In\nthe proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions\nand monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.\nInstead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and\ncommunicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This\nsemantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical\nrelevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the\ntransmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the\nrobot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track\npatient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and\nreliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming\nmatrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and\npower budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic\nsecrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC\nframework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission\nefficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint\nsensing and communication methods.",

    "summary" : "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node\nclassification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often\ndepends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world\nscenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive\ninformation, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.\nFurthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data\nleakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework\nthat enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting\nprivacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by\ndividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each\npropagating information independently through the graph topology. The\naggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This\nframework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves\nrobustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance\nutility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets\ndemonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node\nclassification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our\nanalysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations\nrather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility\nwithout compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further\nconfirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse\nscenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for\ngraph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.",

    "summary" : "Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and\nstatistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly\nempirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is\nkept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate\nprotection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur\nunacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.\nSpecifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with\ndeterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On\nthe other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for\nsmall budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.\nIn the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes\nnecessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility\npreservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we\nargue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust\nprivacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic\nk-anonymity.",

However, no generalized method for constructing an\noptimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists.

    "summary" : "With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict\nbetween the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has\nbecome increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data\nsovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without\ncompromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a\nnovel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient\nZero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key\ncontributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of\nstrong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove\nthat their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., \"age is over 18\")\nwithout revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,\nprivacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic\naccumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in\nlarge-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery\nscheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a\nprototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively\nanalyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,\nverification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a\nlarger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex\ncomputations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted\nsetup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense\npotential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data\neconomy.",

We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a\nnovel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained\nclassifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the\nsource data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source\nfeature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian\nprior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift\nnoisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we\nsample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion\nmodule to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the\ntarget encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries\nwithout source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module\nenhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts\nperformance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.\nDVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for\nexplicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain\nadaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.",

In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in\nisolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone\ncalls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are\navailable, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple\nutterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's\nvocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their\nvoice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content\nanonymization approaches.

We present results in a long-form telephone conversation\nsetting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on\nvoice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based\nanonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.\nOverall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against\ncontent-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure\nanonymity in long-form audio.",

Notably, the Fisher\ninformation matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive\ninformation converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in\nprivacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a\nmultiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits\nonly 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally,\nthe assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is\nnot required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and\nreducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge\nalmost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a\nco-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes.

    "summary" : "Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and\nheartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare\nsystems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional\nwireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the\nstringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,\nand privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In\nthe proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions\nand monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.\nInstead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and\ncommunicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This\nsemantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical\nrelevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the\ntransmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the\nrobot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track\npatient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and\nreliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming\nmatrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and\npower budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic\nsecrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC\nframework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission\nefficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint\nsensing and communication methods.",

However, existing\nMPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable\nfor ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or\ngenomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse\ndata, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to\nprohibitively large memory requirements.\n  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC\nalgorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms\navoid the memory issues of the \"dense\" data representation of classic secure\nmatrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can\nsignificantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000)\nfor realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications\nin which existing protocols are impractical.\n  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can\nbe made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece\nof information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is\nsmall. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there\nis a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row.

    "summary" : "With the exponential growth in mobile applications, protecting user privacy\nhas become even more crucial. Android applications are often known for\ncollecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts,\nlocation, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or\nawareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of\nprivacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying\ndata usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied\non formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these\ntechniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint\nexplosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis\nmethods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility\nand scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we\npropose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM\nreasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and\nexplainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves\na significant F\\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs\non the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid\nand Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules\nor sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides\ncomprehensive and explainable insights into dataflow and leak detection,\nachieving high, quantifiable scores based on the G-Eval metric.",

    "title" : "SMOTE and Mirrors: Exposing Privacy Leakage from Synthetic Minority\n  Oversampling",
    "summary" : "The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one of the most\nwidely used methods for addressing class imbalance and generating synthetic\ndata. Despite its popularity, little attention has been paid to its privacy\nimplications; yet, it is used in the wild in many privacy-sensitive\napplications. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of privacy\nleakage in SMOTE: We begin by showing that prevailing evaluation practices,\ni.e., naive distinguishing and distance-to-closest-record metrics, completely\nfail to detect any leakage and that membership inference attacks (MIAs) can be\ninstantiated with high accuracy. Then, by exploiting SMOTE's geometric\nproperties, we build two novel attacks with very limited assumptions:\nDistinSMOTE, which perfectly distinguishes real from synthetic records in\naugmented datasets, and ReconSMOTE, which reconstructs real minority records\nfrom synthetic datasets with perfect precision and recall approaching one under\nrealistic imbalance ratios. We also provide theoretical guarantees for both\nattacks. Experiments on eight standard imbalanced datasets confirm the\npracticality and effectiveness of these attacks. Overall, our work reveals that\nSMOTE is inherently non-private and disproportionately exposes minority\nrecords, highlighting the need to reconsider its use in privacy-sensitive\napplications.",

    "summary" : "Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and\nstatistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly\nempirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is\nkept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate\nprotection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur\nunacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.\nSpecifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with\ndeterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On\nthe other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for\nsmall budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.\nIn the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes\nnecessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility\npreservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we\nargue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust\nprivacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic\nk-anonymity.",

    "summary" : "Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns\nabout battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,\npractical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled\ndata shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation\nmodels that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While\nself-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are\nnot particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --\nlet alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and\nnoisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model\nbased on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of\nprivacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our\npre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input\nreconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even\nfrom less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation\nlies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level\nsimilarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.\nWith our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted\nmasked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both\ngranular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level\nassociative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich\nrepresentation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,\neven under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer\nand age-induced distribution shifts.

    "summary" : "Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models\nwithout sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors\nin a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability\nand its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy\nguarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with\nresults showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across\npeer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility\ntrade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to\nlimitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show\nthat recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization\n(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By\ngeneralizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL\nalgorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields\ntighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a\nprincipled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce\nMAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that\noutperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.",

    "summary" : "The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:\nachieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected\nwithout consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities\nunder regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising\nprivacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical\nevidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through\nextensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a\nsystematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition\ndatasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our\nmethodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic\ndata: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity\nseparability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and\nbenchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic\nsamples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard\nbenchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of\nsynthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic\ndatasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and\n94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including\nCASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available\nalternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our\nfindings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while\nmaintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even\nthough synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control\nfor bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish\nsynthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative\nalternative for facial recognition research.",

    "summary" : "Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms are deployed in data-sensitive\napplications, such as adaptive clinical trials or user studies. Driven by the\nprivacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of\nfixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli\ndistributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in\nthe non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and\nupper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small\nmultiplicative constant, for any privacy budget $\\epsilon$. First, we provide a\ntighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any $\\delta$-correct\nand $\\epsilon$-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the\nnon-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that\noptimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance\nscaled by $\\epsilon$. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these\ntransportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an\narm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our\nstopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the\nLaplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions.\nThird, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs.\nFor any budget $\\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected\nsample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant\nsmaller than $8$.

In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms\nbuild on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to\nadapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,\nresource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise\nor inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a\nlightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously\nadjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a\nclosed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,\nprivacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),\nlocal privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on\nenvironmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances\nprivacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to\nadaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a\ndynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative\nrisk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead\ndeployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations\ndemonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while\npreserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge\napplications.",

While\nprivacy-preserving techniques for federated learning have been extensively\ndeveloped, methods for scenarios involving bitwise operations, such as\ntree-based vertical federated learning (VFL), are still underexplored.\nTraditional mechanisms, including Shamir's secret sharing and multi-party\ncomputation (MPC), are not optimized for bitwise operations over binary data,\nparticularly in settings where each participant holds a different part of the\nbinary vector. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by\nproposing a novel binary multi-party computation (BiMPC) framework. The BiMPC\nmechanism facilitates privacy-preserving bitwise operations, with a particular\nfocus on dot product computations of binary vectors, ensuring the privacy of\neach individual bit. The core of BiMPC is a novel approach called Dot Product\nvia Modular Addition (DoMA), which uses regular and modular additions for\nefficient binary dot product calculation. To ensure privacy, BiMPC uses random\nmasking in a higher field for linear computations and a three-party oblivious\ntransfer (triot) protocol for non-linear binary operations.

    "summary" : "Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who\nfrequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has\nattempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login\nattempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password\ncreation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing\nmechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we\npropose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing\nrisks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --\ndefined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and\nrepresent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),\nwe perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between\nsites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by\nincorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as\nnodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a\nfederated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user\nsensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset\nof 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that\nPassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further\nvalidate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over\nother state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study.

    "summary" : "When users submit queries to Large Language Models (LLMs), their prompts can\noften contain sensitive data, forcing a difficult choice: Send the query to a\npowerful proprietary LLM providers to achieving state-of-the-art performance\nand risk data exposure, or relying on smaller, local models guarantees data\nprivacy but often results in a degradation of task performance. Prior\napproaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which\nshatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive\ninformation, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge\n(Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and\nintroduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to\nsolve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks,\nlearning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage\nand task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and\ntask-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal\nutility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a\nnew medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity\nof learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.",

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Data in IoT: A Synergistic Approach with\n  Deep Learning and Blockchain",
    "summary" : "The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare has\nrevolutionized patient care by enabling real-time monitoring, personalized\ntreatments, and efficient data management. However, this technological\nadvancement introduces significant security risks, particularly concerning the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive medical data.\nTraditional security measures are often insufficient to address the unique\nchallenges posed by IoT environments, such as heterogeneity, resource\nconstraints, and the need for real-time processing. To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose a comprehensive three-phase security framework designed to enhance\nthe security and reliability of IoT-enabled healthcare systems. In the first\nphase, the framework assesses the reliability of IoT devices using a\nreputation-based trust estimation mechanism, which combines device behavior\nanalytics with off-chain data storage to ensure scalability. The second phase\nintegrates blockchain technology with a lightweight proof-of-work mechanism,\nensuring data immutability, secure communication, and resistance to\nunauthorized access. The third phase employs a lightweight Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) model for anomaly detection and classification, enabling\nreal-time identification of cyber threats. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework outperforms existing methods, achieving a 2% increase in\nprecision, accuracy, and recall, a 5% higher attack detection rate, and a 3%\nreduction in false alarm rate. These improvements highlight the framework's\nability to address critical security concerns while maintaining scalability and\nreal-time performance.",

    "title" : "One Size Fits All? A Modular Adaptive Sanitization Kit (MASK) for\n  Customizable Privacy-Preserving Phone Scam Detection",
    "summary" : "Phone scams remain a pervasive threat to both personal safety and financial\nsecurity worldwide. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong potential in detecting fraudulent behavior by analyzing\ntranscribed phone conversations. However, these capabilities introduce notable\nprivacy risks, as such conversations frequently contain sensitive personal\ninformation that may be exposed to third-party service providers during\nprocessing. In this work, we explore how to harness LLMs for phone scam\ndetection while preserving user privacy. We propose MASK (Modular Adaptive\nSanitization Kit), a trainable and extensible framework that enables dynamic\nprivacy adjustment based on individual preferences. MASK provides a pluggable\narchitecture that accommodates diverse sanitization methods - from traditional\nkeyword-based techniques for high-privacy users to sophisticated neural\napproaches for those prioritizing accuracy. We also discuss potential modeling\napproaches and loss function designs for future development, enabling the\ncreation of truly personalized, privacy-aware LLM-based detection systems that\nbalance user trust and detection effectiveness, even beyond phone scam context.",

    "summary" : "We initiate the study of distribution testing under \\emph{user-level} local\ndifferential privacy, where each of $n$ users contributes $m$ samples from the\nunknown underlying distribution. This setting, albeit very natural, is\nsignificantly more challenging that the usual locally private setting, as for\nthe same parameter $\\varepsilon$ the privacy guarantee must now apply to a full\nbatch of $m$ data points. While some recent work consider distribution\n\\emph{learning} in this user-level setting, nothing was known for even the most\nfundamental testing task, uniformity testing (and its generalization, identity\ntesting).\n  We address this gap, by providing (nearly) sample-optimal user-level LDP\nalgorithms for uniformity and identity testing. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, our main focus is on the private-coin, symmetric setting, which\ndoes not require users to share a common random seed nor to have been assigned\na globally unique identifier.",

    "title" : "PrivaDE: Privacy-preserving Data Evaluation for Blockchain-based Data\n  Marketplaces",
    "summary" : "Evaluating the relevance of data is a critical task for model builders\nseeking to acquire datasets that enhance model performance. Ideally, such\nevaluation should allow the model builder to assess the utility of candidate\ndata without exposing proprietary details of the model. At the same time, data\nproviders must be assured that no information about their data - beyond the\ncomputed utility score - is disclosed to the model builder.\n  In this paper, we present PrivaDE, a cryptographic protocol for\nprivacy-preserving utility scoring and selection of data for machine learning.\nWhile prior works have proposed data evaluation protocols, our approach\nadvances the state of the art through a practical, blockchain-centric design.\nLeveraging the trustless nature of blockchains, PrivaDE enforces\nmalicious-security guarantees and ensures strong privacy protection for both\nmodels and datasets. To achieve efficiency, we integrate several techniques -\nincluding model distillation, model splitting, and cut-and-choose\nzero-knowledge proofs - bringing the runtime to a practical level. Furthermore,\nwe propose a unified utility scoring function that combines empirical loss,\npredictive entropy, and feature-space diversity, and that can be seamlessly\nintegrated into active-learning workflows. Evaluation shows that PrivaDE\nperforms data evaluation effectively, achieving online runtimes within 15\nminutes even for models with millions of parameters.\n  Our work lays the foundation for fair and automated data marketplaces in\ndecentralized machine learning ecosystems.",
