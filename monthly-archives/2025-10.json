    "title" : "Sensitivity, Specificity, and Consistency: A Tripartite Evaluation of\n  Privacy Filters for Synthetic Data Generation",
    "summary" : "The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue\nfor overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering\ntechniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable\ninformation, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their\neffectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous\nevaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary\nto claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current\nfilters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity\nonly for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated\nfrom training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc\nfiltering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods\nmay provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of\npatient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter\ndesign are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive\napplications.",

    "summary" : "The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\ndisproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a\nconstellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain\nunderexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM\nsystems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from\ndata collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent\ncapabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference\nattacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM\nlifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through\ncase studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted\nthreats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers\npublished at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal\nthat while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the\nmost pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches\noffer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a\nfundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving\nbeyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing\ninterdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these\nemerging threats.",

    "summary" : "Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy\nrisk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary\napplications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,\nprovides a privacy-preserving substitute.

In order to handle\nnon-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the\ncentral server that weights local model updates according to their\nsignificance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data\nwhile preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using\nFVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese\nConvolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client\ncontributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global\nmodel.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework\nare superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according\nto experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of\nthe attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and\nCentralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively.

    "summary" : "Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively\non generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer\nlargely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a\nnovel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained\nclassifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the\nsource data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source\nfeature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian\nprior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift\nnoisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we\nsample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion\nmodule to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the\ntarget encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries\nwithout source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module\nenhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts\nperformance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.\nDVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for\nexplicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain\nadaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.",

    "summary" : "The proliferation of digital technologies has led to unprecedented data\ncollection, with facial data emerging as a particularly sensitive commodity.\nCompanies are increasingly leveraging advanced facial recognition technologies,\noften without the explicit consent or awareness of individuals, to build\nsophisticated surveillance capabilities. This practice, fueled by weak and\nfragmented laws in many jurisdictions, has created a regulatory vacuum that\nallows for the commercialization of personal identity and poses significant\nthreats to individual privacy and autonomy. This article introduces the concept\nof Facial Privacy. It analyzes the profound challenges posed by unregulated\nfacial recognition by conducting a comprehensive review of existing legal\nframeworks. It examines and compares regulations such as the GDPR, Brazil's\nLGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, and privacy acts in China, Singapore, South Korea, and\nJapan, alongside sector-specific laws in the United States like the Illinois\nBiometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The analysis highlights the societal\nimpacts of this technology, including the potential for discriminatory bias and\nthe long-lasting harm that can result from the theft of immutable biometric\ndata. Ultimately, the paper argues that existing legal loopholes and\nambiguities leave individuals vulnerable.

Our main contributions are threefold:\nFirstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition\nfor capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting\nchannel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and\nparameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing\nchannels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a\nsingle-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private\nchannels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an\napplication, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet\nunbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private\nchannels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its\nvalidity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds\nwith continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that\nchannels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from\nthe set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate\n(anti-)degradability bounds are not tight.

However, the methods proposed in that\nstudy rely on a white-box setting that adversaries can directly modify the\nsystem prompt. This condition is unlikely to hold in real-world deployments.\nThe limitation raises a critical question: can unprivileged attackers still\ninduce such privacy risks in practical LLM-integrated applications? To address\nthis question, we propose \\textsc{VortexPIA}, a novel indirect prompt injection\nattack that induces privacy extraction in LLM-integrated applications under\nblack-box settings. By injecting token-efficient data containing false\nmemories, \\textsc{VortexPIA} misleads LLMs to actively request private\ninformation in batches. Unlike prior methods, \\textsc{VortexPIA} allows\nattackers to flexibly define multiple categories of sensitive data.

    "summary" : "Diffusion Models have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable\ncapabilities in image generation, albeit at the cost of intensive computation\nrequirement. Meanwhile, despite their widespread deployment in inference\nservices such as Midjourney, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive\ninformation in uploaded user prompts have arisen. Existing solutions either\nlack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to strike an effective balance between\nutility and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ObCLIP, a plug-and-play\nsafeguard that enables oblivious cloud-device hybrid generation. By oblivious,\neach input prompt is transformed into a set of semantically similar candidate\nprompts that differ only in sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). The\ncloud server processes all candidate prompts without knowing which one is the\nreal one, thus preventing any prompt leakage. To mitigate server cost, only a\nsmall portion of denoising steps is performed upon the large cloud model. The\nintermediate latents are then sent back to the client, which selects the\ntargeted latent and completes the remaining denoising using a small device\nmodel. Additionally, we analyze and incorporate several cache-based\naccelerations that leverage temporal and batch redundancy, effectively reducing\ncomputation cost with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that ObCLIP provides rigorous privacy and\ncomparable utility to cloud models with slightly increased server cost.",

    "title" : "FHEON: A Configurable Framework for Developing Privacy-Preserving Neural\n  Networks Using Homomorphic Encryption",
    "summary" : "The widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service raises critical\nprivacy and security concerns, particularly about data confidentiality and\ntrust in both cloud providers and the machine learning models. Homomorphic\nEncryption (HE) has emerged as a promising solution to this problems, allowing\ncomputations on encrypted data without decryption. Despite its potential,\nexisting approaches to integrate HE into neural networks are often limited to\nspecific architectures, leaving a wide gap in providing a framework for easy\ndevelopment of HE-friendly privacy-preserving neural network models similar to\nwhat we have in the broader field of machine learning. In this paper, we\npresent FHEON, a configurable framework for developing privacy-preserving\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models for inference using HE. FHEON\nintroduces optimized and configurable implementations of privacy-preserving CNN\nlayers including convolutional layers, average pooling layers, ReLU activation\nfunctions, and fully connected layers. These layers are configured using\nparameters like input channels, output channels, kernel size, stride, and\npadding to support arbitrary CNN architectures. We assess the performance of\nFHEON using several CNN architectures, including LeNet-5, VGG-11, VGG- 16,\nResNet-20, and ResNet-34. FHEON maintains encrypted-domain accuracies within\n+/- 1% of their plaintext counterparts for ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 models.\nNotably, on a consumer-grade CPU, the models build on FHEON achieved 98.5%\naccuracy with a latency of 13 seconds on MNIST using LeNet-5, and 92.2%\naccuracy with a latency of 403 seconds on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20.\nAdditionally, FHEON operates within a practical memory budget requiring not\nmore than 42.3 GB for VGG-16.",

    "title" : "Privacy Enhancement in Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Adaptive\n  Receive Scaling",
    "summary" : "In Federated Learning (FL) with over-the-air aggregation, the quality of the\nsignal received at the server critically depends on the receive scaling\nfactors. While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and\nimprove training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by\nreducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive\nscaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between\ntraining convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel\nconditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the\noverall R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training\nprocess, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the\nglobal loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we\nobserve that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop\na new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round\nproblems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the\ndynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it\nachieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while\nensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical\nexperiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach\neffectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks without compromising learning performance.",

    "summary" : "Distributed control of connected and automated vehicles has attracted\nconsiderable interest for its potential to improve traffic efficiency and\nsafety. However, such control schemes require sharing privacy-sensitive vehicle\ndata, which introduces risks of information leakage and potential malicious\nactivities. This paper investigates the stability and privacy-preserving\nproperties of distributed platoon control under two types of quantizers:\ndeterministic and probabilistic. For deterministic quantization, we show that\nthe resulting control strategy ensures the system errors remain uniformly\nultimately bounded. Moreover, in the absence of auxiliary information, an\neavesdropper cannot uniquely infer sensitive vehicle states. In contrast, the\nuse of probabilistic quantization enables asymptotic convergence of the vehicle\nplatoon in expectation with bounded variance. Importantly, probabilistic\nquantizers can satisfy differential privacy guarantees, thereby preserving\nprivacy even when the eavesdropper possesses arbitrary auxiliary information.\nWe further analyze the trade-off between control performance and privacy by\nformulating an optimization problem that characterizes the impact of the\nquantization step on both metrics. Numerical simulations are provided to\nillustrate the performance differences between the two quantization strategies.",

Existing methods often\nstruggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse\napplication scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to\nalleviate these drawbacks.

To address these limitations, our initial work\nintroduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding\nwith policy-guided search.

However,\npractical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled\ndata shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation\nmodels that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While\nself-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are\nnot particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --\nlet alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and\nnoisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model\nbased on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of\nprivacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our\npre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input\nreconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even\nfrom less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation\nlies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level\nsimilarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.\nWith our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted\nmasked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both\ngranular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level\nassociative relationships across different snippets.

    "title" : "Spectral Graph Clustering under Differential Privacy: Balancing Privacy,\n  Accuracy, and Efficiency",
    "summary" : "We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential\nprivacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation\nvia randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which\nenforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph.\nImportantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping\nedges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP\nguarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves\n(epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of\nnodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a\nlower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity;\nand (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across\niterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis\nprovides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the\nmisclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks\nvalidate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility\ntrade-offs.",

    "summary" : "We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion\nframework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic\nelectronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.\nRareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human\nPhenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA\nAdverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph\ncomprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this\n8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward\nstochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically\nplausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining\nscore-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces\ntimestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag\ntriples that contain no protected health information. On simulated\nultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by\ngreater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream\npredictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the\nDOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55\nsafe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61\nplus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong\nresistance to re-identification.

We also analyze how the right is currently\nprotected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law. We\nshow that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects\nthree individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and\ntrust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and\norganizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially,\nthe right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a\nstrong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications,\nregardless of the technology used. Hence, the right does not merely serve\nindividual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are\ncrucial for the functioning of our information society.

Based on a comprehensive study using\ncircuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII\nleakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should\nbe responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware\nTargeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and\nsubsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves\nbetter privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall\nof PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to\nreduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis\nshows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing\ndefense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.",

The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection\nnot previously formalized in graph DP.

Along the way, we introduce\ngraph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier\nsubsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space\nincurred by prior work [ELMZ25].

    "summary" : "Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and\nheartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare\nsystems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional\nwireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the\nstringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,\nand privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In\nthe proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions\nand monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.\nInstead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and\ncommunicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This\nsemantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical\nrelevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the\ntransmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the\nrobot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track\npatient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and\nreliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming\nmatrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and\npower budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic\nsecrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC\nframework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission\nefficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint\nsensing and communication methods.",

    "summary" : "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node\nclassification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often\ndepends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world\nscenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive\ninformation, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.\nFurthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data\nleakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework\nthat enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting\nprivacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by\ndividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each\npropagating information independently through the graph topology. The\naggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This\nframework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves\nrobustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance\nutility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets\ndemonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node\nclassification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our\nanalysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations\nrather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility\nwithout compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further\nconfirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse\nscenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for\ngraph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.",

    "summary" : "Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and\nstatistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly\nempirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is\nkept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate\nprotection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur\nunacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.\nSpecifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with\ndeterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On\nthe other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for\nsmall budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.\nIn the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes\nnecessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility\npreservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we\nargue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust\nprivacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic\nk-anonymity.",

However, no generalized method for constructing an\noptimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists.

    "summary" : "With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict\nbetween the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has\nbecome increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data\nsovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without\ncompromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a\nnovel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient\nZero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key\ncontributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of\nstrong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove\nthat their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., \"age is over 18\")\nwithout revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,\nprivacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic\naccumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in\nlarge-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery\nscheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a\nprototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively\nanalyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,\nverification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a\nlarger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex\ncomputations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted\nsetup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense\npotential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data\neconomy.",

We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a\nnovel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained\nclassifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the\nsource data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source\nfeature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian\nprior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift\nnoisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we\nsample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion\nmodule to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the\ntarget encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries\nwithout source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module\nenhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts\nperformance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.\nDVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for\nexplicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain\nadaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.",

In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in\nisolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone\ncalls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are\navailable, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple\nutterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's\nvocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their\nvoice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content\nanonymization approaches.

We present results in a long-form telephone conversation\nsetting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on\nvoice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based\nanonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.\nOverall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against\ncontent-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure\nanonymity in long-form audio.",

Notably, the Fisher\ninformation matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive\ninformation converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in\nprivacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a\nmultiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits\nonly 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally,\nthe assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is\nnot required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and\nreducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge\nalmost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a\nco-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes.

    "summary" : "Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and\nheartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare\nsystems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional\nwireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the\nstringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,\nand privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In\nthe proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions\nand monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.\nInstead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and\ncommunicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This\nsemantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical\nrelevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the\ntransmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the\nrobot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track\npatient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and\nreliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming\nmatrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and\npower budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic\nsecrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC\nframework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission\nefficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint\nsensing and communication methods.",

However, existing\nMPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable\nfor ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or\ngenomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse\ndata, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to\nprohibitively large memory requirements.\n  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC\nalgorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms\navoid the memory issues of the \"dense\" data representation of classic secure\nmatrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can\nsignificantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000)\nfor realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications\nin which existing protocols are impractical.\n  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can\nbe made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece\nof information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is\nsmall. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there\nis a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row.

    "summary" : "With the exponential growth in mobile applications, protecting user privacy\nhas become even more crucial. Android applications are often known for\ncollecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts,\nlocation, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or\nawareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of\nprivacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying\ndata usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied\non formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these\ntechniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint\nexplosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis\nmethods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility\nand scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we\npropose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM\nreasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and\nexplainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves\na significant F\\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs\non the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid\nand Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules\nor sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides\ncomprehensive and explainable insights into dataflow and leak detection,\nachieving high, quantifiable scores based on the G-Eval metric.",

    "title" : "SMOTE and Mirrors: Exposing Privacy Leakage from Synthetic Minority\n  Oversampling",
    "summary" : "The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one of the most\nwidely used methods for addressing class imbalance and generating synthetic\ndata. Despite its popularity, little attention has been paid to its privacy\nimplications; yet, it is used in the wild in many privacy-sensitive\napplications. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of privacy\nleakage in SMOTE: We begin by showing that prevailing evaluation practices,\ni.e., naive distinguishing and distance-to-closest-record metrics, completely\nfail to detect any leakage and that membership inference attacks (MIAs) can be\ninstantiated with high accuracy. Then, by exploiting SMOTE's geometric\nproperties, we build two novel attacks with very limited assumptions:\nDistinSMOTE, which perfectly distinguishes real from synthetic records in\naugmented datasets, and ReconSMOTE, which reconstructs real minority records\nfrom synthetic datasets with perfect precision and recall approaching one under\nrealistic imbalance ratios. We also provide theoretical guarantees for both\nattacks. Experiments on eight standard imbalanced datasets confirm the\npracticality and effectiveness of these attacks. Overall, our work reveals that\nSMOTE is inherently non-private and disproportionately exposes minority\nrecords, highlighting the need to reconsider its use in privacy-sensitive\napplications.",

    "summary" : "Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and\nstatistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly\nempirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is\nkept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate\nprotection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur\nunacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.\nSpecifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with\ndeterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On\nthe other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for\nsmall budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.\nIn the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes\nnecessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility\npreservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we\nargue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust\nprivacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic\nk-anonymity.",

    "summary" : "Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns\nabout battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,\npractical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled\ndata shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation\nmodels that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While\nself-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are\nnot particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --\nlet alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and\nnoisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model\nbased on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of\nprivacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our\npre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input\nreconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even\nfrom less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation\nlies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level\nsimilarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.\nWith our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted\nmasked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both\ngranular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level\nassociative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich\nrepresentation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,\neven under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer\nand age-induced distribution shifts.

    "summary" : "Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models\nwithout sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors\nin a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability\nand its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy\nguarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with\nresults showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across\npeer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility\ntrade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to\nlimitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show\nthat recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization\n(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By\ngeneralizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL\nalgorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields\ntighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a\nprincipled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce\nMAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that\noutperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.",

    "summary" : "The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:\nachieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected\nwithout consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities\nunder regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising\nprivacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical\nevidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through\nextensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a\nsystematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition\ndatasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our\nmethodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic\ndata: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity\nseparability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and\nbenchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic\nsamples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard\nbenchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of\nsynthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic\ndatasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and\n94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including\nCASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available\nalternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our\nfindings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while\nmaintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even\nthough synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control\nfor bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish\nsynthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative\nalternative for facial recognition research.",

    "summary" : "Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms are deployed in data-sensitive\napplications, such as adaptive clinical trials or user studies. Driven by the\nprivacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of\nfixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli\ndistributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in\nthe non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and\nupper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small\nmultiplicative constant, for any privacy budget $\\epsilon$. First, we provide a\ntighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any $\\delta$-correct\nand $\\epsilon$-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the\nnon-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that\noptimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance\nscaled by $\\epsilon$. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these\ntransportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an\narm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our\nstopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the\nLaplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions.\nThird, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs.\nFor any budget $\\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected\nsample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant\nsmaller than $8$.

In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms\nbuild on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to\nadapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,\nresource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise\nor inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a\nlightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously\nadjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a\nclosed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,\nprivacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),\nlocal privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on\nenvironmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances\nprivacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to\nadaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a\ndynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative\nrisk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead\ndeployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations\ndemonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while\npreserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge\napplications.",

While\nprivacy-preserving techniques for federated learning have been extensively\ndeveloped, methods for scenarios involving bitwise operations, such as\ntree-based vertical federated learning (VFL), are still underexplored.\nTraditional mechanisms, including Shamir's secret sharing and multi-party\ncomputation (MPC), are not optimized for bitwise operations over binary data,\nparticularly in settings where each participant holds a different part of the\nbinary vector. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by\nproposing a novel binary multi-party computation (BiMPC) framework. The BiMPC\nmechanism facilitates privacy-preserving bitwise operations, with a particular\nfocus on dot product computations of binary vectors, ensuring the privacy of\neach individual bit. The core of BiMPC is a novel approach called Dot Product\nvia Modular Addition (DoMA), which uses regular and modular additions for\nefficient binary dot product calculation. To ensure privacy, BiMPC uses random\nmasking in a higher field for linear computations and a three-party oblivious\ntransfer (triot) protocol for non-linear binary operations.

    "summary" : "Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who\nfrequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has\nattempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login\nattempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password\ncreation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing\nmechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we\npropose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing\nrisks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --\ndefined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and\nrepresent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),\nwe perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between\nsites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by\nincorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as\nnodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a\nfederated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user\nsensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset\nof 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that\nPassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further\nvalidate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over\nother state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study.

    "summary" : "When users submit queries to Large Language Models (LLMs), their prompts can\noften contain sensitive data, forcing a difficult choice: Send the query to a\npowerful proprietary LLM providers to achieving state-of-the-art performance\nand risk data exposure, or relying on smaller, local models guarantees data\nprivacy but often results in a degradation of task performance. Prior\napproaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which\nshatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive\ninformation, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge\n(Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and\nintroduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to\nsolve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks,\nlearning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage\nand task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and\ntask-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal\nutility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a\nnew medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity\nof learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.",

    "summary" : "The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare has\nrevolutionized patient care by enabling real-time monitoring, personalized\ntreatments, and efficient data management.

To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose a comprehensive three-phase security framework designed to enhance\nthe security and reliability of IoT-enabled healthcare systems.

    "summary" : "Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as\ndrafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility.",

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation directly\non encrypted data on the server side, making it a promising approach for PPML.\nHowever, it introduces significant communication and computation overhead on\nthe client side, making it impractical for edge devices. Hybrid homomorphic\nencryption (HHE) addresses this limitation by combining symmetric encryption\n(SE) with FHE to reduce the computational cost on the client side, and\ncombining with an FHE-friendly SE can also lessen the processing overhead on\nthe server side, making it a more balanced and efficient alternative.

In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance\nexecution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a\nheterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate\nprivacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to\nuntrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts\nan information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy:\nsecurity-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of\nattention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an\nSGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are\nperformed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the\nenclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and\nevaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that\nSecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance,\noffering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.",

    "summary" : "Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows\nlocal users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.\nHowever, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is\nchallenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as\ndecentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy\naccounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential\nprivacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods\ntailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which\nquantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,\nand Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise\ninjection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov\nchain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification\narising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.\nExperiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield\nconsistently tighter $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared\nto R\\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in\ndecentralized privacy accounting.",

    "summary" : "While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware\nmachine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of\nprivacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have\nproposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the\naverage-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate\nthe group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity\nacross group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the\nworst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their\npractical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nmembership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case\nprivacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nprovides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a\nreliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to\npromote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD\nalgorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired\nby the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies.

Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely\nemployed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional\nknowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for\ncorrelated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise\nmaximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By\nincorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a\nprecise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In\nthe entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy\nguarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the\nindividual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper\nbound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets.

The proposed PTMF can be employed in various\nways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy\nthreats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this\npaper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by\ndeveloping a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both\nindustry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their\nopinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat\nactors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11\nprivacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the\ncritical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining\n11 privacy threats.

Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and\nconjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There\nis little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification\nobjectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the\ncomplex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In\nthis study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system\nspecification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:\nWe reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with\npractitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the\nunderlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We\ndeveloped and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification\nfor PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The\nrelationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is\ninstrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the\nmodeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to\nspecification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification\ntransparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed\nthroughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to\nachieve PbD.

    "summary" : "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves\nprivacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its\nprototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled\nby analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \\emph{over-the-air\nFL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \\emph{frenemy}\nin the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while\nproviding a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,\nformally quantified by \\emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,\nnevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as\nprior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted\ntypes of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a\nsingle-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study\nAirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station\n(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which\nclaimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to\nensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as\na \\emph{perk} even \\emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a\nnovel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on\nmodel parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and\nnon-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power\nallocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which\nalso reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising\ntraining. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive\nnumerical results.",

    "summary" : "While semantic communication (SemCom) improves transmission efficiency by\nfocusing on task-relevant information, it also raises critical privacy\nconcerns. Many existing secure SemCom approaches rely on restrictive or\nimpractical assumptions, such as favorable channel conditions for the\nlegitimate user or prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's model. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure SemCom framework for\nimage transmission over wiretap channels, leveraging differential privacy (DP)\nto provide approximate privacy guarantees. Specifically, our approach first\nextracts disentangled semantic representations from source images using\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) inversion method, and then selectively\nperturbs private semantic representations with approximate DP noise. Distinct\nfrom conventional DP-based protection methods, we introduce DP noise with\nlearnable pattern, instead of traditional white Gaussian or Laplace noise,\nachieved through adversarial training of neural networks (NNs). This design\nmitigates the inherent non-invertibility of DP while effectively protecting\nprivate information. Moreover, it enables explicitly controllable security\nlevels by adjusting the privacy budget according to specific security\nrequirements, which is not achieved in most existing secure SemCom approaches.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared with the previous DP-based\nmethod and direct transmission, the proposed method significantly degrades the\nreconstruction quality for the eavesdropper, while introducing only slight\ndegradation in task performance. Under comparable security levels, our approach\nachieves an LPIPS advantage of 0.06-0.29 and an FPPSR advantage of 0.10-0.86\nfor the legitimate user compared with the previous DP-based method.",

    "summary" : "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across\nvarious tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related\nto intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks,\nwhere adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services.\nThese attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats\nto revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking\nsolution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model\ntraceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study\nthe vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\\delta$-STEAL, a\nnovel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark\ndetectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\\delta$-STEAL\ninjects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during\nfine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP)\nguarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect\noutputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise\nto these pairs, $\\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it\ndifficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used,\nthereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that\n$\\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of\nup to $96.95\\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model\nutility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack\neffectiveness and model utility.

Forecasting models are typically trained to\nminimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream\ndecision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been\nstudied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption\nof DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing\nsensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising\nserious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL\nframework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to\nsafeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and\ngradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we\ndesign a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic\nencryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.\nAdditionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition\nalgorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous\nload patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including\nreal-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy\nbut also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to\nexisting methods.",

    "summary" : "As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud\ninfrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a\nsignificant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a\ncompelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,\nallowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.\nHowever, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines\nremains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,\nand model compatibility issues.\n  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of\ncloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving\nML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules\nwith Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel\nencrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,\noptimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus\nadjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource\nconsumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference\nacceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional\nHE pipelines.

    "summary" : "Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic\nsequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected\ncontent. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic\ndata, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to\noverfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to\nestimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only\nquantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation\nmethods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical\ndeployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value\nstatistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic\nsample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy\nleak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET\nreliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse\ndata modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited\nsample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We\ncompare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show\nits advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments\nthrough qualitative and quantitative outputs.

To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision\nmodels trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,\nand then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the\nintercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment.

This perspective links\nthe security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the\nrole of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would\notherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting\nchannel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold:\nFirstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition\nfor capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting\nchannel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and\nparameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing\nchannels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a\nsingle-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private\nchannels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an\napplication, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet\nunbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private\nchannels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its\nvalidity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds\nwith continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that\nchannels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from\nthe set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate\n(anti-)degradability bounds are not tight.

    "summary" : "A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or\nmeasurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral\nnorm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank\napproximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a\ndata-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius\nnorm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or\nunder-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,\ncaptures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility\nguarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds\nfor symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem\nand explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and\nnorm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\\|(A + E)_p - A_p\\|$,\nwhere $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up\nto a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility\nguarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the\nliterature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from\ncomplex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,\nincluding polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world\ndatasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under\ndiverse perturbation regimes.",

    "summary" : "The integration of clinical data offers significant potential for the\ndevelopment of personalized medicine. However, its use is severely restricted\nby the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts\nwith rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the\ndevelopment of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel,\nmulti-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a\nsimulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to\nrepresent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any\nsensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC)\nfederated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client\nconfiguration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes\nplace within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct\nsupervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by\nthe hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only\nreturn aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance\nfeedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the\nclinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a\ncKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context\nof real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated\nduring the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner\nChildren's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient\nclassification and diagnosis without access to real data.

    "summary" : "Privacy concerns have become increasingly critical in modern AI and data\nscience applications, where sensitive information is collected, analyzed, and\nshared across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobility. While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to\nsequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can\ncollectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally. These\nfindings underscore the need for new privacy-preserving frameworks that\nexplicitly model temporal dependencies, such as time-aware differential privacy\nor sequential data obfuscation strategies.",

In its\nprototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled\nby analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \\emph{over-the-air\nFL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \\emph{frenemy}\nin the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while\nproviding a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,\nformally quantified by \\emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,\nnevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as\nprior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted\ntypes of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a\nsingle-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study\nAirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station\n(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which\nclaimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to\nensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as\na \\emph{perk} even \\emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a\nnovel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on\nmodel parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and\nnon-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power\nallocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which\nalso reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising\ntraining.

In addition, we identify\nand examine real-world cases related to bystander privacy, demonstrating how\ncurrent deployments can impact non-users.

A multi-stage\npre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth\nlow-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to\ndenoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device\ndeployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an\nembedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI\nacquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition\naccuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence\ndetection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference\nachieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering\nsixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response\nlatency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,\nprivacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and\npervasive computing environments.",

    "title" : "PEEL: A Poisoning-Exposing Encoding Theoretical Framework for Local\n  Differential Privacy",
    "summary" : "Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a widely adopted privacy-protection model\nin the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and\nscalable nature. However, it is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and existing\ndefenses either incur prohibitive resource overheads or rely on domain-specific\nprior knowledge, limiting their practical deployment. To address these\nlimitations, we propose PEEL, a Poisoning-Exposing Encoding theoretical\nframework for LDP, which departs from resource- or prior-dependent\ncountermeasures and instead leverages the inherent structural consistency of\nLDP-perturbed data. As a non-intrusive post-processing module, PEEL amplifies\nstealthy poisoning effects by re-encoding LDP-perturbed data via\nsparsification, normalization, and low-rank projection, thereby revealing both\noutput and rule poisoning attacks through structural inconsistencies in the\nreconstructed space. Theoretical analysis proves that PEEL, integrated with\nLDP, retains unbiasedness and statistical accuracy, while being robust to\nexpose both output and rule poisoning attacks. Moreover, evaluation results\nshow that LDP-integrated PEEL not only outperforms four state-of-the-art\ndefenses in terms of poisoning exposure accuracy but also significantly reduces\nclient-side computational costs, making it highly suitable for large-scale IoT\ndeployments.",

We\npresent FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that\nflags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user\nscrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,\nand UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal\ndata leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:\nbaseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,\nadversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a\ndataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%\nmacro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of\napproximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant\nvariant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to\n14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality\nfake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest\nperformance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve\nas a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of\nmisinformation across social networks.

    "summary" : "Recent improvement gains in large language models (LLMs) have lead to\neveryday usage of AI-based Conversational Agents (CAs). At the same time, LLMs\nare vulnerable to an array of threats, including jailbreaks and, for example,\ncausing remote code execution when fed specific inputs. As a result, users may\nunintentionally introduce risks, for example, by uploading malicious files or\ndisclosing sensitive information. However, the extent to which such user\nbehaviors occur and thus potentially facilitate exploits remains largely\nunclear. To shed light on this issue, we surveyed a representative sample of\n3,270 UK adults in 2024 using Prolific. A third of these use CA services such\nas ChatGPT or Gemini at least once a week. Of these ``regular users'', up to a\nthird exhibited behaviors that may enable attacks, and a fourth have tried\njailbreaking (often out of understandable reasons such as curiosity, fun or\ninformation seeking). Half state that they sanitize data and most participants\nreport not sharing sensitive data. However, few share very sensitive data such\nas passwords. The majority are unaware that their data can be used to train\nmodels and that they can opt-out. Our findings suggest that current academic\nthreat models manifest in the wild, and mitigations or guidelines for the\nsecure usage of CAs should be developed. In areas critical to security and\nprivacy, CAs must be equipped with effective AI guardrails to prevent, for\nexample, revealing sensitive information to curious employees. Vendors need to\nincrease efforts to prevent the entry of sensitive data, and to create\ntransparency with regard to data usage policies and settings.",

    "summary" : "We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for\nsimultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest\ncomputed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust\nand highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,\nmainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately\nannotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare\nenvironments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from\ndifferences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical\npurposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past\ndata, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our\napproach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship\nbetween previously learned knowledge and new information across different\ntraining stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.\nSpecifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our\nmethod mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual\npretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature\ndistillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge\ndistillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of\nthe model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we\nvalidate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different\nwindow settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other\napproaches.",

    "summary" : "With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing\nconcern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data\nin interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with\nthese models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if\nexposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this\nchallenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with\nSemantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a\nsemantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when\nusing remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our\napproach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with\nsemantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of\nconversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are\nautomatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,\nprivacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world\nconversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to\nassess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's\nresponse. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a\nfactor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.",

    "summary" : "Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for\nthe compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and\nconjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There\nis little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification\nobjectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the\ncomplex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In\nthis study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system\nspecification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:\nWe reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with\npractitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the\nunderlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We\ndeveloped and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification\nfor PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The\nrelationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is\ninstrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the\nmodeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to\nspecification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification\ntransparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed\nthroughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to\nachieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in\nspecifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure\ncompliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to\naddress practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future\neffective operationalization of the approach.",
