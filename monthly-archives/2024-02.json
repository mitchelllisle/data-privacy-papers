    "summary" : "Federated learning is widely considered to be as a privacy-aware learning\nmethod because no training data is exchanged directly between clients.\nNevertheless, there are threats to privacy in federated learning, and privacy\ncountermeasures have been studied. However, we note that common and unique\nprivacy threats among typical types of federated learning have not been\ncategorized and described in a comprehensive and specific way. In this paper,\nwe describe privacy threats and countermeasures for the typical types of\nfederated learning; horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning,\nand transfer federated learning.",

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Distributed Learning for Residential Short-Term Load\n  Forecasting",
    "summary" : "In the realm of power systems, the increasing involvement of residential\nusers in load forecasting applications has heightened concerns about data\nprivacy. Specifically, the load data can inadvertently reveal the daily\nroutines of residential users, thereby posing a risk to their property\nsecurity. While federated learning (FL) has been employed to safeguard user\nprivacy by enabling model training without the exchange of raw data, these FL\nmodels have shown vulnerabilities to emerging attack techniques, such as Deep\nLeakage from Gradients and poisoning attacks. To counteract these, we initially\nemploy a Secure-Aggregation (SecAgg) algorithm that leverages multiparty\ncomputation cryptographic techniques to mitigate the risk of gradient leakage.\nHowever, the introduction of SecAgg necessitates the deployment of additional\nsub-center servers for executing the multiparty computation protocol, thereby\nescalating computational complexity and reducing system robustness, especially\nin scenarios where one or more sub-centers are unavailable. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a Markovian Switching-based distributed training\nframework, the convergence of which is substantiated through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis. The Distributed Markovian Switching (DMS) topology shows\nstrong robustness towards the poisoning attacks as well. Case studies employing\nreal-world power system load data validate the efficacy of our proposed\nalgorithm. It not only significantly minimizes communication complexity but\nalso maintains accuracy levels comparable to traditional FL methods, thereby\nenhancing the scalability of our load forecasting algorithm.",

    "summary" : "With the mainstream integration of machine learning into security-sensitive\ndomains such as healthcare and finance, concerns about data privacy have\nintensified. Conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been found\nvulnerable to several attacks that can leak sensitive data. Particularly, model\ninversion (MI) attacks enable the reconstruction of data samples that have been\nused to train the model. Neuromorphic architectures have emerged as a paradigm\nshift in neural computing, enabling asynchronous and energy-efficient\ncomputation. However, little to no existing work has investigated the privacy\nof neuromorphic architectures against model inversion. Our study is motivated\nby the intuition that the non-differentiable aspect of spiking neural networks\n(SNNs) might result in inherent privacy-preserving properties, especially\nagainst gradient-based attacks. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a\nthorough exploration of SNNs' privacy-preserving capabilities. Specifically, we\ndevelop novel inversion attack strategies that are comprehensively designed to\ntarget SNNs, offering a comparative analysis with their conventional ANN\ncounterparts. Our experiments, conducted on diverse event-based and static\ndatasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies and\ntherefore questions the assumption of inherent privacy-preserving in\nneuromorphic architectures.",

    "summary" : "Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to disclose private information about the\ntraining data by abusing access to the pre-trained models. These attacks enable\nadversaries to reconstruct high-fidelity data that closely aligns with the\nprivate training data, which has raised significant privacy concerns. Despite\nthe rapid advances in the field, we lack a comprehensive overview of existing\nMI attacks and defenses. To fill this gap, this paper thoroughly investigates\nthis field and presents a holistic survey. Firstly, our work briefly reviews\nthe traditional MI on machine learning scenarios.

    "title" : "Embedding Large Language Models into Extended Reality: Opportunities and\n  Challenges for Inclusion, Engagement, and Privacy",
    "summary" : "Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence\n(AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR)\ndevices and setups being more pervasive. While these devices and setups provide\nusers with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different\nsensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters\nare utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques. In this\npaper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them\nin virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences\nthrough prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs\nfor particular purposes. We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity\nfor XR use. In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational\ncapabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might\nhelp XR be more used in everyday life. Lastly, we speculate that combining the\ninformation provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric\ndata obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions. While\nstudying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences\nshould also be investigated. In summary, despite some challenges, embedding\nLLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.",

    "summary" : "In Vehicle-to-Everything networks that involve multi-hop communication, the\nRoad Side Units (RSUs) typically aim to collect location information from the\nparticipating vehicles to provide security and network diagnostics features.\nWhile the vehicles commonly use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for\nnavigation, they may refrain from sharing their precise GPS coordinates with\nthe RSUs due to privacy concerns. Therefore, to jointly address the high\nlocalization requirements by the RSUs as well as the vehicles' privacy, we\npresent a novel spatial-provenance framework wherein each vehicle uses Bloom\nfilters to embed their partial location information when forwarding the\npackets. In this framework, the RSUs and the vehicles agree upon fragmenting\nthe coverage area into several smaller regions so that the vehicles can embed\nthe identity of their regions through Bloom filters. Given the probabilistic\nnature of Bloom filters, we derive an analytical expression on the error-rates\nin provenance recovery and then pose an optimization problem to choose the\nunderlying parameters. With the help of extensive simulation results, we show\nthat our method offers near-optimal Bloom filter parameters in learning spatial\nprovenance. Some interesting trade-offs between the communication-overhead,\nspatial privacy of the vehicles and the error rates in provenance recovery are\nalso discussed.",

    "title" : "Fairness and Privacy Guarantees in Federated Contextual Bandits",
    "summary" : "This paper considers the contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with\nfairness and privacy guarantees in a federated environment. We consider\nmerit-based exposure as the desired fair outcome, which provides exposure to\neach action in proportion to the reward associated. We model the algorithm's\neffectiveness using fairness regret, which captures the difference between fair\noptimal policy and the policy output by the algorithm. Applying fair CMAB\nalgorithm to each agent individually leads to fairness regret linear in the\nnumber of agents. We propose that collaborative -- federated learning can be\nmore effective and provide the algorithm Fed-FairX-LinUCB that also ensures\ndifferential privacy. The primary challenge in extending the existing privacy\nframework is designing the communication protocol for communicating required\ninformation across agents. A naive protocol can either lead to weaker privacy\nguarantees or higher regret. We design a novel communication protocol that\nallows for (i) Sub-linear theoretical bounds on fairness regret for\nFed-FairX-LinUCB and comparable bounds for the private counterpart,\nPriv-FairX-LinUCB (relative to single-agent learning), (ii) Effective use of\nprivacy budget in Priv-FairX-LinUCB. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\nproposed algorithm with extensive simulations-based experiments. We show that\nboth Fed-FairX-LinUCB and Priv-FairX-LinUCB achieve near-optimal fairness\nregret.",

CATEs can be\nestimated with high accuracy if distributed data across multiple parties can be\ncentralized. However, it is difficult to aggregate such data if they contain\nprivacy information. To address this issue, we proposed data collaboration\ndouble machine learning (DC-DML), a method that can estimate CATE models with\nprivacy preservation of distributed data, and evaluated the method through\nnumerical experiments. Our contributions are summarized in the following three\npoints. First, our method enables estimation and testing of semi-parametric\nCATE models without iterative communication on distributed data.\nSemi-parametric or non-parametric CATE models enable estimation and testing\nthat is more robust to model mis-specification than parametric models. However,\nto our knowledge, no communication-efficient method has been proposed for\nestimating and testing semi-parametric or non-parametric CATE models on\ndistributed data. Second, our method enables collaborative estimation between\ndifferent parties as well as multiple time points because the\ndimensionality-reduced intermediate representations can be accumulated.
