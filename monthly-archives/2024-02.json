[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00342v1","title":"Survey of Privacy Threats and Countermeasures in Federated Learning","summary":"Federated learning is widely considered to be as a privacy-aware learning\nmethod because no training data is exchanged directly between clients.\nNevertheless, there are threats to privacy in federated learning, and privacy\ncountermeasures have been studied. However, we note that common and unique\nprivacy threats among typical types of federated learning have not been\ncategorized and described in a comprehensive and specific way. In this paper,\nwe describe privacy threats and countermeasures for the typical types of\nfederated learning; horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning,\nand transfer federated learning.","updated":"2024-02-01T05:13:14Z","published":"2024-02-01T05:13:14Z","authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Hayashitani"},{"name":"Junki Mori"},{"name":"Isamu Teranishi"}],"categories":["cs.LG","cs.CR"]}]
