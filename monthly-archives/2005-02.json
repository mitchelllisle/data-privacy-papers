[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502010v1","title":"Gaussian Operations and Privacy","summary":"We consider the possibilities offered by Gaussian states and operations for two honest parties, Alice and Bob, to obtain privacy against a third eavesdropping party, Eve. We first extend the security analysis of the protocol proposed in M. Navascues et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 010502 (2005). Then, we prove that a generalized version of this protocol does not allow to distill a secret key out of bound entangled Gaussian states.","updated":"2012-04-30T00:02:11Z","published":"2005-02-01T15:04:33Z","authors":[{"name":"Miguel Navascues"},{"name":"Antonio Acin"}],"categories":["quant-ph"]}]
