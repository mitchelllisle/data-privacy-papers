    "summary" : "Linear regression is a fundamental tool for statistical analysis, which has\nmotivated the development of linear regression methods that satisfy provable\nprivacy guarantees so that the learned model reveals little about any one data\npoint used to construct it. Most existing privacy-preserving linear regression\nmethods rely on the well-established framework of differential privacy, while\nthe newly proposed PAC Privacy has not yet been explored in this context. In\nthis paper, we systematically compare linear regression models trained with\ndifferential privacy and PAC privacy across three real-world datasets,\nobserving several key findings that impact the performance of\nprivacy-preserving linear regression.",

    "summary" : "Cross-device Federated Analytics (FA) is a distributed computation paradigm\ndesigned to answer analytics queries about and derive insights from data held\nlocally on users' devices. On-device computations combined with other privacy\nand security measures ensure that only minimal data is transmitted off-device,\nachieving a high standard of data protection. Despite FA's broad relevance, the\napplicability of existing FA systems is limited by compromised accuracy; lack\nof flexibility for data analytics; and an inability to scale effectively.

    "title" : "A privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion algorithm for\n  collective decision-making",
    "summary" : "The theory of evidence reasoning has been applied to collective\ndecision-making in recent years. However, existing distributed evidence fusion\nmethods lead to participants' preference leakage and fusion failures as they\ndirectly exchange raw evidence and do not assess evidence credibility like\ncentralized credible evidence fusion (CCEF) does. To do so, a\nprivacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion method with three-level\nconsensus (PCEF) is proposed in this paper. In evidence difference measure\n(EDM) neighbor consensus, an evidence-free equivalent expression of EDM among\nneighbored agents is derived with the shared dot product protocol for pignistic\nprobability and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective\nprobabilities, so that evidence privacy is guaranteed due to such irreversible\nevidence transformation. In EDM network consensus, the non-neighbored EDMs are\ninferred and neighbored EDMs reach uniformity via interaction between linear\naverage consensus (LAC) and low-rank matrix completion with rank adaptation to\nguarantee EDM consensus convergence and no solution of inferring raw evidence\nin numerical iteration style. In fusion network consensus, a privacy-preserving\nLAC with a self-cancelling differential privacy term is proposed, where each\nagent adds its randomness to the sharing content and step-by-step cancels such\nrandomness in consensus iterations. Besides, the sufficient condition of the\nconvergence to the CCEF is explored, and it is proven that raw evidence is\nimpossibly inferred in such an iterative consensus. The simulations show that\nPCEF is close to CCEF both in credibility and fusion results and obtains higher\ndecision accuracy with less time-comsuming than existing methods.",

    "summary" : "Auditing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) in the\nfinal model setting is challenging and often results in empirical lower bounds\nthat are significantly looser than theoretical privacy guarantees. We introduce\na novel auditing method that achieves tighter empirical lower bounds without\nadditional assumptions by crafting worst-case adversarial samples through\nloss-based input-space auditing. Our approach surpasses traditional\ncanary-based heuristics and is effective in both white-box and black-box\nscenarios. Specifically, with a theoretical privacy budget of $\\varepsilon =\n10.0$, our method achieves empirical lower bounds of $6.68$ in white-box\nsettings and $4.51$ in black-box settings, compared to the baseline of $4.11$\nfor MNIST. Moreover, we demonstrate that significant privacy auditing results\ncan be achieved using in-distribution (ID) samples as canaries, obtaining an\nempirical lower bound of $4.33$ where traditional methods produce near-zero\nleakage detection. Our work offers a practical framework for reliable and\naccurate privacy auditing in differentially private machine learning.",

    "summary" : "Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for privacy-preserving\ndata analysis, but implementing it correctly has proven challenging. Prior work\nhas focused on verifying DP at a high level, assuming the foundations are\ncorrect and a perfect source of randomness is available. However, the\nunderlying theory of differential privacy can be very complex and subtle. Flaws\nin basic mechanisms and random number generation have been a critical source of\nvulnerabilities in real-world DP systems.\n  In this paper, we present SampCert, the first comprehensive, mechanized\nfoundation for differential privacy. SampCert is written in Lean with over\n12,000 lines of proof. It offers a generic and extensible notion of DP, a\nframework for constructing and composing DP mechanisms, and formally verified\nimplementations of Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms. SampCert provides\n(1) a mechanized foundation for developing the next generation of\ndifferentially private algorithms, and (2) mechanically verified primitives\nthat can be deployed in production systems. Indeed, SampCert's verified\nalgorithms power the DP offerings of Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating\nits real-world impact.\n  SampCert's key innovations include: (1) A generic DP foundation that can be\ninstantiated for various DP definitions (e.g., pure, concentrated, R\\'enyi DP);\n(2) formally verified discrete Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms that\navoid the pitfalls of floating-point implementations; and (3) a simple\nprobability monad and novel proof techniques that streamline the formalization.\nTo enable proving complex correctness properties of DP and random number\ngeneration, SampCert makes heavy use of Lean's extensive Mathlib library,\nleveraging theorems in Fourier analysis, measure and probability theory, number\ntheory, and topology.",

    "summary" : "Software systems have been evolving rapidly and inevitably introducing bugs\nat an increasing rate, leading to significant losses in resources consumed by\nsoftware maintenance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable potential in enhancing software development and maintenance\npractices, particularly in automated program repair (APR) with improved\naccuracy and efficiency of bug fixing. However, LLM-based APR heavily relies on\nhigh-quality code repositories. A larger portion of existing code repositories\nare for private use and proprietary assets from various industries, reflecting\nmore diversity and nuances in the data since real-world industries often have\nmore extensive software development practices, which cannot be covered by\nmerely public datasets. Therefore, utilizing private datasets shows significant\npotential in enhancing software development and maintenance. However, obtaining\nsuch data from various industries is hindered by data privacy concerns, as\ncompanies are reluctant to share their codebases. To address the gap, we\ninvestigate the use of federated learning as a privacy-preserving approach that\nenables private entities to fine-tune LLMs on proprietary and decentralized\ndata, facilitating the collaboration between clients to fully utilize their\ndata to help enhance software development and maintenance. Our evaluation\nreveals that federated fine-tuning can effectively enhance program repair\ncapabilities. Notably, the impact of heterogeneous code on LLM fine-tuning is\nnegligible, indicating that real-world industries can benefit from\ncollaborative development regardless of diverse data distributions.\nFurthermore, each type of federated algorithm exhibits unique strengths across\ndifferent LLMs, suggesting that fine-tuning for program repair can be enhanced\nby tailoring the optimization process to specific characteristics of different\nLLMs.",

    "summary" : "Accurate diagnosis of gait impairments is often hindered by subjective or\ncostly assessment methods, with current solutions requiring either expensive\nmulti-camera equipment or relying on subjective clinical observation. There is\na critical need for accessible, objective tools that can aid in gait assessment\nwhile preserving patient privacy. In this work, we present a mobile\nphone-based, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI) system for\nclassifying gait impairments and introduce a novel dataset of 743 videos\ncapturing seven distinct gait patterns. The dataset consists of frontal and\nsagittal views of trained subjects simulating normal gait and six types of\npathological gait (circumduction, Trendelenburg, antalgic, crouch,\nParkinsonian, and vaulting), recorded using standard mobile phone cameras. Our\nsystem achieved 86.5% accuracy using combined frontal and sagittal views, with\nsagittal views generally outperforming frontal views except for specific gait\npatterns like Circumduction. Model feature importance analysis revealed that\nfrequency-domain features and entropy measures were critical for classifcation\nperformance, specifically lower limb keypoints proved most important for\nclassification, aligning with clinical understanding of gait assessment. These\nfindings demonstrate that mobile phone-based systems can effectively classify\ndiverse gait patterns while preserving privacy through on-device processing.\nThe high accuracy achieved using simulated gait data suggests their potential\nfor rapid prototyping of gait analysis systems, though clinical validation with\npatient data remains necessary.

    "title" : "Preserving Privacy in Software Composition Analysis: A Study of\n  Technical Solutions and Enhancements",
    "summary" : "Software composition analysis (SCA) denotes the process of identifying\nopen-source software components in an input software application. SCA has been\nextensively developed and adopted by academia and industry. However, we notice\nthat the modern SCA techniques in industry scenarios still need to be improved\ndue to privacy concerns. Overall, SCA requires the users to upload their\napplications' source code to a remote SCA server, which then inspects the\napplications and reports the component usage to users. This process is\nprivacy-sensitive since the applications may contain sensitive information,\nsuch as proprietary source code, algorithms, trade secrets, and user data.\n  Privacy concerns have prevented the SCA technology from being used in\nreal-world scenarios. Therefore, academia and the industry demand\nprivacy-preserving SCA solutions. For the first time, we analyze the privacy\nrequirements of SCA and provide a landscape depicting possible technical\nsolutions with varying privacy gains and overheads. In particular, given that\nde facto SCA frameworks are primarily driven by code similarity-based\ntechniques, we explore combining several privacy-preserving protocols to\nencapsulate the similarity-based SCA framework. Among all viable solutions, we\nfind that multi-party computation (MPC) offers the strongest privacy guarantee\nand plausible accuracy; it, however, incurs high overhead (184 times). We\noptimize the MPC-based SCA framework by reducing the amount of crypto protocol\ntransactions using program analysis techniques. The evaluation results show\nthat our proposed optimizations can reduce the MPC-based SCA overhead to only\n8.5% without sacrificing SCA's privacy guarantee or accuracy.",

Fortunately, the countries are trying to overcome the\nsituation by actively carrying out vaccinations.

    "summary" : "Trajectory collection is fundamental for location-based services but often\ninvolves sensitive information, such as a user's daily routine, raising privacy\nconcerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) provides provable privacy guarantees\nfor users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory\ncollection methods ensure LDP only for discrete location spaces, where the\nnumber of locations affects their privacy guarantees and trajectory utility.\nMoreover, the location space is often naturally continuous, such as in flying\nand sailing trajectories, making these methods unsuitable. This paper proposes\ntwo trajectory collection methods that ensure LDP for continuous spaces:\nTraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C,\nwhich perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are\ntheoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility. TraCS can\nalso be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the\nnearest discrete points. It is independent of the number of locations and has\nonly $\\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation\nresults on discrete location spaces validate this advantage and show that TraCS\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility,\nespecially for large privacy parameters.",

    "summary" : "Mental health has increasingly become a global issue that reveals the\nlimitations of traditional conversational psychotherapy, constrained by\nlocation, time, expense, and privacy concerns. In response to these challenges,\nwe introduce SoulSpeak, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled chatbot designed\nto democratize access to psychotherapy. SoulSpeak improves upon the\ncapabilities of standard LLM-enabled chatbots by incorporating a novel\ndual-memory component that combines short-term and long-term context via\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer personalized responses while\nensuring the preservation of user privacy and intimacy through a dedicated\nprivacy module. In addition, it leverages a counseling chat dataset of\ntherapist-client interactions and various prompting techniques to align the\ngenerated responses with psychotherapeutic methods. We introduce two fine-tuned\nBERT models to evaluate the system against existing LLMs and human therapists:\nthe Conversational Psychotherapy Preference Model (CPPM) to simulate human\npreference among responses and another to assess response relevance to user\ninput. CPPM is useful for training and evaluating psychotherapy-focused\nlanguage models independent from SoulSpeak, helping with the constrained\nresources available for psychotherapy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the\ndual-memory component and the robustness of the privacy module are also\nexamined. Our findings highlight the potential and challenge of enhancing\nmental health care by offering an alternative that combines the expertise of\ntraditional therapy with the advantages of LLMs, providing a promising way to\naddress the accessibility and personalization gap in current mental health\nservices.",

    "summary" : "To mitigate the rising concern about privacy leakage, the federated\nrecommender (FR) paradigm emerges, in which decentralized clients co-train the\nrecommendation model without exposing their raw user-item rating data. The\ndifferentially private federated recommender (DPFR) further enhances FR by\ninjecting differentially private (DP) noises into clients. Yet, current DPFRs,\nsuffering from noise distortion, cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. Various\nefforts have been dedicated to improving DPFRs by adaptively allocating the\nprivacy budget over the learning process. However, due to the intricate\nrelation between privacy budget allocation and model accuracy, existing works\nare still far from maximizing DPFR accuracy. To address this challenge, we\ndevelop BGTplanner (Budget Planner) to strategically allocate the privacy\nbudget for each round of DPFR training, improving overall training performance.\nSpecifically, we leverage the Gaussian process regression and historical\ninformation to predict the change in recommendation accuracy with a certain\nallocated privacy budget. Additionally, Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) is\nharnessed to make privacy budget allocation decisions by reconciling the\ncurrent improvement and long-term privacy constraints. Our extensive\nexperimental results on real datasets demonstrate that \\emph{BGTplanner}\nachieves an average improvement of 6.76\\% in training performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary" : "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that\ninherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thus\nproviding some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a risk\nof privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is an\nadapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the natural\nsuperposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physical\nlayer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) through\na decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussian\nnoise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additional\nartificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Although\nprimarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where a\nresource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every even\niteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power control\nstrategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx as\nshown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectiveness\nof our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strong\nemphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificial\nnoise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacy\nwithout affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacy\nanalysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform a\nconvergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous data\ndistributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy and\naccuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithms\noutperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d.\nFEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness in\nensuring strict privacy.",

This paper introduces the concept of ``privacy drift\", an\ninnovative framework that parallels the well-known phenomenon of concept drift.\nWhile concept drift addresses the variability in model accuracy over time due\nto changes in the data, privacy drift encapsulates the variation in the leakage\nof private information as models undergo incremental training.

Our results highlight a complex interplay between\nmodel accuracy and privacy safeguards, revealing that enhancements in model\nperformance can lead to increased privacy risks. We provide empirical evidence\nfrom experiments on customized datasets derived from CIFAR-100 (Canadian\nInstitute for Advanced Research, 100 classes), showcasing the impact of data\nand concept drift on privacy.

    "summary" : "This paper presents a differentially private approach to Kaplan-Meier\nestimation that achieves accurate survival probability estimates while\nsafeguarding individual privacy. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is widely used in\nsurvival analysis to estimate survival functions over time, yet applying it to\nsensitive datasets, such as clinical records, risks revealing private\ninformation. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm that applies\ntime-indexed Laplace noise, dynamic clipping, and smoothing to produce a\nprivacy-preserving survival curve while maintaining the cumulative structure of\nthe Kaplan-Meier estimator. By scaling noise over time, the algorithm accounts\nfor decreasing sensitivity as fewer individuals remain at risk, while dynamic\nclipping and smoothing prevent extreme values and reduce fluctuations,\npreserving the natural shape of the survival curve.\n  Our results, evaluated on the NCCTG lung cancer dataset, show that the\nproposed method effectively lowers root mean squared error (RMSE) and enhances\naccuracy across privacy budgets ($\\epsilon$). At $\\epsilon = 10$, the algorithm\nachieves an RMSE as low as 0.04, closely approximating non-private estimates.\nAdditionally, membership inference attacks reveal that higher $\\epsilon$ values\n(e.g., $\\epsilon \\geq 6$) significantly reduce influential points, particularly\nat higher thresholds, lowering susceptibility to inference attacks. These\nfindings confirm that our approach balances privacy and utility, advancing\nprivacy-preserving survival analysis.",

    "summary" : "With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there\nhas been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly\nsensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose,\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists\nLLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge\nsources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking\nsensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore\nRAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The\nmain challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate\nanswers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an\nalgorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require\nthe sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our\nextensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the\nnon-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\\epsilon\\approx 10$\nacross different models and datasets.",

In the first model, there are\n$\\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from\nthe user to the $N$ servers), $\\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the\ndownlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where\n$|\\mathcal{E}_1|, |\\mathcal{E}_2| \\leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as\n\\emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers.

In the second model, we consider the case with\nByzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm\nthe privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by\nlistening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is\nimportant to note the considerable difference between the two threat models,\nsince the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the\nByzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers,\nthat assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent\nof the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in\n\\cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be\nfunctions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that\ncan produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat\nmodel, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers\ntogether. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine\nservers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having\nstatic eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.",

To achieve accurate spatial\ndistribution estimation, the analysis needs to collect sufficient user data.\nHowever, collecting data directly from individuals could compromise their\nprivacy. Most previous works focused on private distribution estimation for\none-dimensional data, which does not consider spatial data relation and leads\nto poor accuracy for spatial distribution estimation. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of private spatial distribution estimation, where we collect\nspatial data from individuals and aim to minimize the distance between the\nactual distribution and estimated one under Local Differential Privacy (LDP).\nTo leverage the numerical nature of the domain, we project spatial data and its\nrelationships onto a one-dimensional distribution. We then use this projection\nto estimate the overall spatial distribution. Specifically, we propose a\nreporting mechanism called Disk Area Mechanism (DAM), which projects the\nspatial domain onto a line and optimizes the estimation using the sliced\nWasserstein distance. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness\nof our DAM approach on both real and synthetic data sets, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, such as Multi-dimensional Square Wave Mechanism\n(MDSW) and Subset Exponential Mechanism with Geo-I (SEM-Geo-I).

    "summary" : "Recent studies have discovered that LLMs have serious privacy leakage\nconcerns, where an LLM may be fooled into outputting private information under\ncarefully crafted adversarial prompts. These risks include leaking system\nprompts, personally identifiable information, training data, and model\nparameters. Most existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage rely on\nhumans to craft the adversarial prompts. A few automated methods are proposed\nfor system prompt extraction, but they cannot be applied to more severe risks\n(e.g., training data extraction) and have limited effectiveness even for system\nprompt extraction.\n  In this paper, we propose PrivAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework\nfor LLM privacy leakage. We formulate different risks as a search problem with\na unified attack goal. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through\nreinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for\ndifferent target models under different risks. We propose a novel reward\nfunction to provide effective and fine-grained rewards for the attack agent.\nFinally, we introduce customizations to better fit our general framework to\nsystem prompt extraction and training data extraction. Through extensive\nevaluations, we first show that PrivAgent outperforms existing automated\nmethods in system prompt leakage against six popular LLMs. Notably, our\napproach achieves a 100% success rate in extracting system prompts from\nreal-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We also show PrivAgent's\neffectiveness in extracting training data from an open-source LLM with a\nsuccess rate of 5.9%. We further demonstrate PrivAgent's effectiveness in\nevading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better\nsafety alignment.

    "title" : "A Game-Theoretic Framework for Privacy-Aware Client Sampling in\n  Federated Learning",
    "summary" : "This paper aims to design a Privacy-aware Client Sampling framework in\nFederated learning, named FedPCS, to tackle the heterogeneous client sampling\nissues and improve model performance. First, we obtain a pioneering upper bound\nfor the accuracy loss of the FL model with privacy-aware client sampling\nprobabilities. Based on this, we model the interactions between the central\nserver and participating clients as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I,\nthe central server designs the optimal time-dependent reward for cost\nminimization by considering the trade-off between the accuracy loss of the FL\nmodel and the rewards allocated. In Stage II, each client determines the\ncorrection factor that dynamically adjusts its privacy budget based on the\nreward allocated to maximize its utility. To surmount the obstacle of\napproximating other clients' private information, we introduce the mean-field\nestimator to estimate the average privacy budget. We analytically demonstrate\nthe existence and convergence of the fixed point for the mean-field estimator\nand derive the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium to obtain the optimal strategy\nprofile. By rigorously theoretical convergence analysis, we guarantee the\nrobustness of FedPCS. Moreover, considering the conventional sampling strategy\nin privacy-preserving FL, we prove that the random sampling approach's PoA can\nbe arbitrarily large. To remedy such efficiency loss, we show that the proposed\nprivacy-aware client sampling strategy successfully reduces PoA, which is upper\nbounded by a reachable constant. To address the challenge of varying privacy\nrequirements throughout different training phases in FL, we extend our model\nand analysis and derive the adaptive optimal sampling ratio for the central\nserver. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof FedPCS compared with the existing SOTA FL strategies under IID and Non-IID\ndatasets.",

    "summary" : "The growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in customer support has\nsignificantly improved operational efficiency and user experience. However,\ntraditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local\ntraining on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance\nchallenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nand California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving\ntechniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated\nlearning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability,\nand complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning\n(PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in\na zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates\nthe need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to\ngenerate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data\nanonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust\npost-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This\ncombination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances\nscalability and operational efficiency. Empirical analysis demonstrates that\nthe PP-ZSL framework provides accurate, privacy-compliant responses while\nsignificantly lowering the costs and complexities of deploying AI-driven\ncustomer support systems. The study highlights potential applications across\nindustries, including financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, legal\nsupport, telecommunications, and government services. By addressing the dual\nchallenges of privacy and performance, this framework establishes a foundation\nfor secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant AI applications in customer\ninteractions.",

Thus it is data of\nthe people and by the people in the home capturing their presence, arrival and\ndeparture, typical domestic activities, bad habits, health status etc. Based on\nprevious as well as ongoing research we know that people are actually able to\nmake sense of simple sensor data and that they will make use of it for their\nown purposes. Simple sensors, when critically reflected, are often only\n\"simple\" in a technical sense.

    "summary" : "Adversarial robustness, the ability of a model to withstand manipulated\ninputs that cause errors, is essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models in real-world applications. However, previous studies\nhave shown that enhancing adversarial robustness through adversarial training\nincreases vulnerability to privacy attacks. While differential privacy can\nmitigate these attacks, it often compromises robustness against both natural\nand adversarial samples. Our analysis reveals that differential privacy\ndisproportionately impacts low-risk samples, causing an unintended performance\ndrop. To address this, we propose DeMem, which selectively targets high-risk\nsamples, achieving a better balance between privacy protection and model\nrobustness. DeMem is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into various\nadversarial training techniques. Extensive evaluations across multiple training\nmethods and datasets demonstrate that DeMem significantly reduces privacy\nleakage while maintaining robustness against both natural and adversarial\nsamples. These results confirm DeMem's effectiveness and broad applicability in\nenhancing privacy without compromising robustness.",

    "summary" : "Large Language Models are trained on extensive datasets that often contain\nsensitive, human-generated information, raising significant concerns about\nprivacy breaches. While certified unlearning approaches offer strong privacy\nguarantees, they rely on restrictive model assumptions that are not applicable\nto LLMs. As a result, various unlearning heuristics have been proposed, with\nthe associated privacy risks assessed only empirically. The standard evaluation\npipelines typically randomly select data for removal from the training set,\napply unlearning techniques, and use membership inference attacks to compare\nthe unlearned models against models retrained without the to-be-unlearned data.\nHowever, since every data point is subject to the right to be forgotten,\nunlearning should be considered in the worst-case scenario from the privacy\nperspective. Prior work shows that data outliers may exhibit higher\nmemorization effects. Intuitively, they are harder to be unlearn and thus the\nprivacy risk of unlearning them is underestimated in the current evaluation. In\nthis paper, we leverage minority data to identify such a critical flaw in\npreviously widely adopted evaluations. We substantiate this claim through\ncarefully designed experiments, including unlearning canaries related to\nminority groups, inspired by privacy auditing literature. Using personally\nidentifiable information as a representative minority identifier, we\ndemonstrate that minority groups experience at least 20% more privacy leakage\nin most cases across six unlearning approaches, three MIAs, three benchmark\ndatasets, and two LLMs of different scales. Given that the right to be\nforgotten should be upheld for every individual, we advocate for a more\nrigorous evaluation of LLM unlearning methods.

To achieve accurate spatial\ndistribution estimation, the analysis needs to collect sufficient user data.\nHowever, collecting data directly from individuals could compromise their\nprivacy. Most previous works focused on private distribution estimation for\none-dimensional data, which does not consider spatial data relation and leads\nto poor accuracy for spatial distribution estimation. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of private spatial distribution estimation, where we collect\nspatial data from individuals and aim to minimize the distance between the\nactual distribution and estimated one under Local Differential Privacy (LDP).\nTo leverage the numerical nature of the domain, we project spatial data and its\nrelationships onto a one-dimensional distribution. We then use this projection\nto estimate the overall spatial distribution. Specifically, we propose a\nreporting mechanism called Disk Area Mechanism (DAM), which projects the\nspatial domain onto a line and optimizes the estimation using the sliced\nWasserstein distance. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness\nof our DAM approach on both real and synthetic data sets, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, such as Multi-dimensional Square Wave Mechanism\n(MDSW) and Subset Exponential Mechanism with Geo-I (SEM-Geo-I).

    "summary" : "This paper presents a novel method to generate differentially private tabular\ndatasets for hierarchical data, with a specific focus on origin-destination\n(O/D) trips. The approach builds upon the TopDown algorithm, a constraint-based\nmechanism designed to incorporate invariant queries into tabular data,\ndeveloped by the US Census. O/D hierarchical data refers to datasets\nrepresenting trips between geographical areas organized in a hierarchical\nstructure (e.g., region $\\rightarrow$ province $\\rightarrow$ city). The\ndeveloped method is crafted to improve accuracy on queries spanning wider\ngeographical areas that can be obtained by aggregation. Maintaining high\naccuracy for aggregated geographical queries is a crucial attribute of the\ndifferentially private dataset, particularly for practitioners. Furthermore,\nthe approach is designed to minimize false positives detection and to replicate\nthe sparsity of the sensitive data. The key technical contributions of this\npaper include a novel TopDown algorithm that employs constrained optimization\nwith Chebyshev distance minimization, with theoretical guarantees based on the\nmaximum absolute error. Additionally, we propose a new integer optimization\nalgorithm that significantly reduces the incidence of false positives. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using both real-world and\nsynthetic O/D datasets, demonstrating its ability to generate private data with\nhigh utility and a reduced number of false positives.

The use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) allow\nfor the execution of de-identification applications on the cloud without the\nneed for a user to trust the third-party application provider. In this paper,\nwe present \\textit{SPIDEr - Secure Pipeline for Information De-Identification\nwith End-to-End Encryption}, our implementation of an end-to-end encrypted data\nde-identification pipeline. SPIDEr supports classical anonymisation techniques\nsuch as suppression, pseudonymisation, generalisation, and aggregation, as well\nas techniques that offer a formal privacy guarantee such as k-anonymisation and\ndifferential privacy. To enable scalability and improve performance on\nconstrained TEE hardware, we enable batch processing of data for differential\nprivacy computations. We present our design of the control flows for end-to-end\nsecure execution of de-identification operations within a TEE. As part of the\ncontrol flow for running SPIDEr within the TEE, we perform attestation, a\nprocess that verifies that the software binaries were properly instantiated on\na known, trusted platform.",

    "title" : "On the Generation and Removal of Speaker Adversarial Perturbation for\n  Voice-Privacy Protection",
    "summary" : "Neural networks are commonly known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks\nmounted through subtle perturbation on the input data. Recent development in\nvoice-privacy protection has shown the positive use cases of the same technique\nto conceal speaker's voice attribute with additive perturbation signal\ngenerated by an adversarial network. This paper examines the reversibility\nproperty where an entity generating the adversarial perturbations is authorized\nto remove them and restore original speech (e.g., the speaker him/herself). A\nsimilar technique could also be used by an investigator to deanonymize a\nvoice-protected speech to restore criminals' identities in security and\nforensic analysis. In this setting, the perturbation generative module is\nassumed to be known in the removal process. To this end, a joint training of\nperturbation generation and removal modules is proposed. Experimental results\non the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrated that the subtle perturbations added to\nthe original speech can be predicted from the anonymized speech while achieving\nthe goal of privacy protection. By removing these perturbations from the\nanonymized sample, the original speech can be restored. Audio samples can be\nfound in \\url{https://voiceprivacy.github.io/Perturbation-Generation-Removal/}.",

    "title" : "ScaleOT: Privacy-utility-scalable Offsite-tuning with Dynamic\n  LayerReplace and Selective Rank Compression",
    "summary" : "Offsite-tuning is a privacy-preserving method for tuning large language\nmodels (LLMs) by sharing a lossy compressed emulator from the LLM owners with\ndata owners for downstream task tuning. This approach protects the privacy of\nboth the model and data owners. However, current offsite tuning methods often\nsuffer from adaptation degradation, high computational costs, and limited\nprotection strength due to uniformly dropping LLM layers or relying on\nexpensive knowledge distillation. To address these issues, we propose ScaleOT,\na novel privacy-utility-scalable offsite-tuning framework that effectively\nbalances privacy and utility. ScaleOT introduces a novel layerwise lossy\ncompression algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to obtain the importance\nof each layer. It employs lightweight networks, termed harmonizers, to replace\nthe raw LLM layers. By combining important original LLM layers and harmonizers\nin different ratios, ScaleOT generates emulators tailored for optimal\nperformance with various model scales for enhanced privacy protection.\nAdditionally, we present a rank reduction method to further compress the\noriginal LLM layers, significantly enhancing privacy with negligible impact on\nutility. Comprehensive experiments show that ScaleOT can achieve nearly\nlossless offsite tuning performance compared with full fine-tuning while\nobtaining better model privacy.",
