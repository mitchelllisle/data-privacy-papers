    "summary" : "Linear regression is a fundamental tool for statistical analysis, which has\nmotivated the development of linear regression methods that satisfy provable\nprivacy guarantees so that the learned model reveals little about any one data\npoint used to construct it. Most existing privacy-preserving linear regression\nmethods rely on the well-established framework of differential privacy, while\nthe newly proposed PAC Privacy has not yet been explored in this context. In\nthis paper, we systematically compare linear regression models trained with\ndifferential privacy and PAC privacy across three real-world datasets,\nobserving several key findings that impact the performance of\nprivacy-preserving linear regression.",

    "summary" : "Cross-device Federated Analytics (FA) is a distributed computation paradigm\ndesigned to answer analytics queries about and derive insights from data held\nlocally on users' devices. On-device computations combined with other privacy\nand security measures ensure that only minimal data is transmitted off-device,\nachieving a high standard of data protection. Despite FA's broad relevance, the\napplicability of existing FA systems is limited by compromised accuracy; lack\nof flexibility for data analytics; and an inability to scale effectively.

    "title" : "A privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion algorithm for\n  collective decision-making",
    "summary" : "The theory of evidence reasoning has been applied to collective\ndecision-making in recent years. However, existing distributed evidence fusion\nmethods lead to participants' preference leakage and fusion failures as they\ndirectly exchange raw evidence and do not assess evidence credibility like\ncentralized credible evidence fusion (CCEF) does. To do so, a\nprivacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion method with three-level\nconsensus (PCEF) is proposed in this paper. In evidence difference measure\n(EDM) neighbor consensus, an evidence-free equivalent expression of EDM among\nneighbored agents is derived with the shared dot product protocol for pignistic\nprobability and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective\nprobabilities, so that evidence privacy is guaranteed due to such irreversible\nevidence transformation. In EDM network consensus, the non-neighbored EDMs are\ninferred and neighbored EDMs reach uniformity via interaction between linear\naverage consensus (LAC) and low-rank matrix completion with rank adaptation to\nguarantee EDM consensus convergence and no solution of inferring raw evidence\nin numerical iteration style. In fusion network consensus, a privacy-preserving\nLAC with a self-cancelling differential privacy term is proposed, where each\nagent adds its randomness to the sharing content and step-by-step cancels such\nrandomness in consensus iterations. Besides, the sufficient condition of the\nconvergence to the CCEF is explored, and it is proven that raw evidence is\nimpossibly inferred in such an iterative consensus. The simulations show that\nPCEF is close to CCEF both in credibility and fusion results and obtains higher\ndecision accuracy with less time-comsuming than existing methods.",

    "summary" : "Auditing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) in the\nfinal model setting is challenging and often results in empirical lower bounds\nthat are significantly looser than theoretical privacy guarantees. We introduce\na novel auditing method that achieves tighter empirical lower bounds without\nadditional assumptions by crafting worst-case adversarial samples through\nloss-based input-space auditing. Our approach surpasses traditional\ncanary-based heuristics and is effective in both white-box and black-box\nscenarios. Specifically, with a theoretical privacy budget of $\\varepsilon =\n10.0$, our method achieves empirical lower bounds of $6.68$ in white-box\nsettings and $4.51$ in black-box settings, compared to the baseline of $4.11$\nfor MNIST. Moreover, we demonstrate that significant privacy auditing results\ncan be achieved using in-distribution (ID) samples as canaries, obtaining an\nempirical lower bound of $4.33$ where traditional methods produce near-zero\nleakage detection. Our work offers a practical framework for reliable and\naccurate privacy auditing in differentially private machine learning.",

    "summary" : "Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for privacy-preserving\ndata analysis, but implementing it correctly has proven challenging. Prior work\nhas focused on verifying DP at a high level, assuming the foundations are\ncorrect and a perfect source of randomness is available. However, the\nunderlying theory of differential privacy can be very complex and subtle. Flaws\nin basic mechanisms and random number generation have been a critical source of\nvulnerabilities in real-world DP systems.\n  In this paper, we present SampCert, the first comprehensive, mechanized\nfoundation for differential privacy. SampCert is written in Lean with over\n12,000 lines of proof. It offers a generic and extensible notion of DP, a\nframework for constructing and composing DP mechanisms, and formally verified\nimplementations of Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms. SampCert provides\n(1) a mechanized foundation for developing the next generation of\ndifferentially private algorithms, and (2) mechanically verified primitives\nthat can be deployed in production systems. Indeed, SampCert's verified\nalgorithms power the DP offerings of Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating\nits real-world impact.\n  SampCert's key innovations include: (1) A generic DP foundation that can be\ninstantiated for various DP definitions (e.g., pure, concentrated, R\\'enyi DP);\n(2) formally verified discrete Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms that\navoid the pitfalls of floating-point implementations; and (3) a simple\nprobability monad and novel proof techniques that streamline the formalization.\nTo enable proving complex correctness properties of DP and random number\ngeneration, SampCert makes heavy use of Lean's extensive Mathlib library,\nleveraging theorems in Fourier analysis, measure and probability theory, number\ntheory, and topology.",

    "summary" : "Software systems have been evolving rapidly and inevitably introducing bugs\nat an increasing rate, leading to significant losses in resources consumed by\nsoftware maintenance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable potential in enhancing software development and maintenance\npractices, particularly in automated program repair (APR) with improved\naccuracy and efficiency of bug fixing. However, LLM-based APR heavily relies on\nhigh-quality code repositories. A larger portion of existing code repositories\nare for private use and proprietary assets from various industries, reflecting\nmore diversity and nuances in the data since real-world industries often have\nmore extensive software development practices, which cannot be covered by\nmerely public datasets. Therefore, utilizing private datasets shows significant\npotential in enhancing software development and maintenance. However, obtaining\nsuch data from various industries is hindered by data privacy concerns, as\ncompanies are reluctant to share their codebases. To address the gap, we\ninvestigate the use of federated learning as a privacy-preserving approach that\nenables private entities to fine-tune LLMs on proprietary and decentralized\ndata, facilitating the collaboration between clients to fully utilize their\ndata to help enhance software development and maintenance. Our evaluation\nreveals that federated fine-tuning can effectively enhance program repair\ncapabilities. Notably, the impact of heterogeneous code on LLM fine-tuning is\nnegligible, indicating that real-world industries can benefit from\ncollaborative development regardless of diverse data distributions.\nFurthermore, each type of federated algorithm exhibits unique strengths across\ndifferent LLMs, suggesting that fine-tuning for program repair can be enhanced\nby tailoring the optimization process to specific characteristics of different\nLLMs.",

    "summary" : "Accurate diagnosis of gait impairments is often hindered by subjective or\ncostly assessment methods, with current solutions requiring either expensive\nmulti-camera equipment or relying on subjective clinical observation. There is\na critical need for accessible, objective tools that can aid in gait assessment\nwhile preserving patient privacy. In this work, we present a mobile\nphone-based, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI) system for\nclassifying gait impairments and introduce a novel dataset of 743 videos\ncapturing seven distinct gait patterns. The dataset consists of frontal and\nsagittal views of trained subjects simulating normal gait and six types of\npathological gait (circumduction, Trendelenburg, antalgic, crouch,\nParkinsonian, and vaulting), recorded using standard mobile phone cameras. Our\nsystem achieved 86.5% accuracy using combined frontal and sagittal views, with\nsagittal views generally outperforming frontal views except for specific gait\npatterns like Circumduction. Model feature importance analysis revealed that\nfrequency-domain features and entropy measures were critical for classifcation\nperformance, specifically lower limb keypoints proved most important for\nclassification, aligning with clinical understanding of gait assessment. These\nfindings demonstrate that mobile phone-based systems can effectively classify\ndiverse gait patterns while preserving privacy through on-device processing.\nThe high accuracy achieved using simulated gait data suggests their potential\nfor rapid prototyping of gait analysis systems, though clinical validation with\npatient data remains necessary.

    "title" : "Preserving Privacy in Software Composition Analysis: A Study of\n  Technical Solutions and Enhancements",
    "summary" : "Software composition analysis (SCA) denotes the process of identifying\nopen-source software components in an input software application. SCA has been\nextensively developed and adopted by academia and industry. However, we notice\nthat the modern SCA techniques in industry scenarios still need to be improved\ndue to privacy concerns. Overall, SCA requires the users to upload their\napplications' source code to a remote SCA server, which then inspects the\napplications and reports the component usage to users. This process is\nprivacy-sensitive since the applications may contain sensitive information,\nsuch as proprietary source code, algorithms, trade secrets, and user data.\n  Privacy concerns have prevented the SCA technology from being used in\nreal-world scenarios. Therefore, academia and the industry demand\nprivacy-preserving SCA solutions. For the first time, we analyze the privacy\nrequirements of SCA and provide a landscape depicting possible technical\nsolutions with varying privacy gains and overheads. In particular, given that\nde facto SCA frameworks are primarily driven by code similarity-based\ntechniques, we explore combining several privacy-preserving protocols to\nencapsulate the similarity-based SCA framework. Among all viable solutions, we\nfind that multi-party computation (MPC) offers the strongest privacy guarantee\nand plausible accuracy; it, however, incurs high overhead (184 times). We\noptimize the MPC-based SCA framework by reducing the amount of crypto protocol\ntransactions using program analysis techniques. The evaluation results show\nthat our proposed optimizations can reduce the MPC-based SCA overhead to only\n8.5% without sacrificing SCA's privacy guarantee or accuracy.",

Fortunately, the countries are trying to overcome the\nsituation by actively carrying out vaccinations.

    "summary" : "Trajectory collection is fundamental for location-based services but often\ninvolves sensitive information, such as a user's daily routine, raising privacy\nconcerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) provides provable privacy guarantees\nfor users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory\ncollection methods ensure LDP only for discrete location spaces, where the\nnumber of locations affects their privacy guarantees and trajectory utility.\nMoreover, the location space is often naturally continuous, such as in flying\nand sailing trajectories, making these methods unsuitable. This paper proposes\ntwo trajectory collection methods that ensure LDP for continuous spaces:\nTraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C,\nwhich perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are\ntheoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility. TraCS can\nalso be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the\nnearest discrete points. It is independent of the number of locations and has\nonly $\\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation\nresults on discrete location spaces validate this advantage and show that TraCS\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility,\nespecially for large privacy parameters.",

    "summary" : "Mental health has increasingly become a global issue that reveals the\nlimitations of traditional conversational psychotherapy, constrained by\nlocation, time, expense, and privacy concerns. In response to these challenges,\nwe introduce SoulSpeak, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled chatbot designed\nto democratize access to psychotherapy. SoulSpeak improves upon the\ncapabilities of standard LLM-enabled chatbots by incorporating a novel\ndual-memory component that combines short-term and long-term context via\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer personalized responses while\nensuring the preservation of user privacy and intimacy through a dedicated\nprivacy module. In addition, it leverages a counseling chat dataset of\ntherapist-client interactions and various prompting techniques to align the\ngenerated responses with psychotherapeutic methods. We introduce two fine-tuned\nBERT models to evaluate the system against existing LLMs and human therapists:\nthe Conversational Psychotherapy Preference Model (CPPM) to simulate human\npreference among responses and another to assess response relevance to user\ninput. CPPM is useful for training and evaluating psychotherapy-focused\nlanguage models independent from SoulSpeak, helping with the constrained\nresources available for psychotherapy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the\ndual-memory component and the robustness of the privacy module are also\nexamined. Our findings highlight the potential and challenge of enhancing\nmental health care by offering an alternative that combines the expertise of\ntraditional therapy with the advantages of LLMs, providing a promising way to\naddress the accessibility and personalization gap in current mental health\nservices.",

    "summary" : "To mitigate the rising concern about privacy leakage, the federated\nrecommender (FR) paradigm emerges, in which decentralized clients co-train the\nrecommendation model without exposing their raw user-item rating data. The\ndifferentially private federated recommender (DPFR) further enhances FR by\ninjecting differentially private (DP) noises into clients. Yet, current DPFRs,\nsuffering from noise distortion, cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. Various\nefforts have been dedicated to improving DPFRs by adaptively allocating the\nprivacy budget over the learning process. However, due to the intricate\nrelation between privacy budget allocation and model accuracy, existing works\nare still far from maximizing DPFR accuracy. To address this challenge, we\ndevelop BGTplanner (Budget Planner) to strategically allocate the privacy\nbudget for each round of DPFR training, improving overall training performance.\nSpecifically, we leverage the Gaussian process regression and historical\ninformation to predict the change in recommendation accuracy with a certain\nallocated privacy budget. Additionally, Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) is\nharnessed to make privacy budget allocation decisions by reconciling the\ncurrent improvement and long-term privacy constraints. Our extensive\nexperimental results on real datasets demonstrate that \\emph{BGTplanner}\nachieves an average improvement of 6.76\\% in training performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary" : "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that\ninherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thus\nproviding some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a risk\nof privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is an\nadapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the natural\nsuperposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physical\nlayer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) through\na decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussian\nnoise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additional\nartificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Although\nprimarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where a\nresource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every even\niteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power control\nstrategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx as\nshown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectiveness\nof our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strong\nemphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificial\nnoise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacy\nwithout affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacy\nanalysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform a\nconvergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous data\ndistributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy and\naccuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithms\noutperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d.\nFEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness in\nensuring strict privacy.",

This paper introduces the concept of ``privacy drift\", an\ninnovative framework that parallels the well-known phenomenon of concept drift.\nWhile concept drift addresses the variability in model accuracy over time due\nto changes in the data, privacy drift encapsulates the variation in the leakage\nof private information as models undergo incremental training.

Our results highlight a complex interplay between\nmodel accuracy and privacy safeguards, revealing that enhancements in model\nperformance can lead to increased privacy risks. We provide empirical evidence\nfrom experiments on customized datasets derived from CIFAR-100 (Canadian\nInstitute for Advanced Research, 100 classes), showcasing the impact of data\nand concept drift on privacy.

    "title" : "A Differentially Private Kaplan-Meier Estimator for Privacy-Preserving\n  Survival Analysis",
    "summary" : "This paper presents a differentially private approach to Kaplan-Meier\nestimation that achieves accurate survival probability estimates while\nsafeguarding individual privacy. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is widely used in\nsurvival analysis to estimate survival functions over time, yet applying it to\nsensitive datasets, such as clinical records, risks revealing private\ninformation. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm that applies\ntime-indexed Laplace noise, dynamic clipping, and smoothing to produce a\nprivacy-preserving survival curve while maintaining the cumulative structure of\nthe Kaplan-Meier estimator. By scaling noise over time, the algorithm accounts\nfor decreasing sensitivity as fewer individuals remain at risk, while dynamic\nclipping and smoothing prevent extreme values and reduce fluctuations,\npreserving the natural shape of the survival curve.\n  Our results, evaluated on the NCCTG lung cancer dataset, show that the\nproposed method effectively lowers root mean squared error (RMSE) and enhances\naccuracy across privacy budgets ($\\epsilon$). At $\\epsilon = 10$, the algorithm\nachieves an RMSE as low as 0.04, closely approximating non-private estimates.\nAdditionally, membership inference attacks reveal that higher $\\epsilon$ values\n(e.g., $\\epsilon \\geq 6$) significantly reduce influential points, particularly\nat higher thresholds, lowering susceptibility to inference attacks. These\nfindings confirm that our approach balances privacy and utility, advancing\nprivacy-preserving survival analysis.",

    "title" : "Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Differential\n  Privacy",
    "summary" : "With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there\nhas been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly\nsensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose,\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists\nLLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge\nsources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking\nsensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore\nRAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The\nmain challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate\nanswers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an\nalgorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require\nthe sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our\nextensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the\nnon-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\\epsilon\\approx 10$\nacross different models and datasets.",

    "summary" : "Gesture tracking technology provides users with a hands free interactive\nexperience without the need to hold or touch devices. However, current gesture\ntracking research has primarily focused on tracking accuracy while neglecting\nissues of user privacy protection and security. This study aims to develop a\ngesture tracking system based on frequency hopping RFID signals that\neffectively protects user privacy without compromising tracking efficiency and\naccuracy. By introducing frequency hopping technology, we have designed a\nmechanism that prevents potential eavesdroppers from obtaining raw RFID\nsignals, thereby enhancing the systems privacy protection capabilities. The\nsystem architec ture includes the collection of RFID signals, data processing,\nsignal recovery, and gesture tracking. Experimental results show that our\nmethod significantly improves privacy protection levels while maintaining real\ntime and accuracy. This research not only provides a new perspective for the\nfield of gesture tracking but also offers valuable insights for the use of RFID\ntechnology in privacy-sensitive applications.",
